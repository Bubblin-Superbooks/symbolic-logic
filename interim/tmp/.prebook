These subtle difficulties seem to lie at the root of every Tree of Knowledge, and they are <em>far</em> more hopeless to grapple with than any that occur in its higher branches. For example, the difficulties of the Forty-Seventh Proposition of Euclid are mere child’s play compared with the mental torture endured in the effort to think out the essential nature of a straight Line. And, in the present work, the difficulties of the “5 Liars” Problem, at , are “trifles, light as air,” compared with the bewildering question “What is a Thing?”"

This proof was given, in the earlier editions, incidentally, in the course of the discussion of the Biliteral Diagram: but its <em>proper</em> place, in this treatise, is where I have now introduced it."

Some of the Premisses were so worded that their Terms were not Specieses of the Univ. named in the Dictionary, but of a larger Class, of which the Univ. was only a portion. In all such cases, it was intended that the Reader should perceive that what was asserted of the larger Class was thereby asserted of the Univ., and should ignore, as superfluous, all that it asserted of its <em>other</em> portion. Thus, in Ex. 15, the Univ. was stated to be “ducks in this village,” and the third Premiss was “Mrs. Bond has no gray ducks,” i.e. “No gray ducks are ducks belonging to Mrs. Bond.” Here the Terms are <em>not</em> Specieses of the Univ., but of the larger Class “ducks,” of which the Univ. is only a portion: and it was intended that the Reader should perceive that what is here asserted of “ ducks” is thereby asserted of “ ducks in this village.” and should treat this Premiss as if it were “Mrs. Bond has no gray ducks in this village,” and should ignore, as superfluous, what it asserts as to the <em>other</em> portion of the Class “ducks,” viz. “ Mrs. Bond has no gray ducks <em>out of</em> this village”."

It is certainly, a most bewildering and unsatisfactory theory: one cannot help feeling that there is a great lack of <em>substance</em> in all this shadowy host——that, as the procession of phantoms glides before us, there is not <em>one</em> that we can pounce upon, and say “<em>Here</em> is a Proposition that <em>must</em> be either true or false!”——that it is but a Barmecide Feast, to which we have been bidden——and that its prototype is to be found in that mythical island, whose inhabitants “earned a precarious living by taking in each others’ washing”! By simply translating “telling 2 Truths” into “taking <em>both</em> of 2 condiments (salt and mustard),” “telling 2 Lies” into “taking <em>neither</em> of them” and “telling a Truth and a Lie (order not specified)” into “taking only <em>one</em> condiment (it is not specified <em>which</em>),” I have escaped all those metaphysical puzzles, and have produced a Problem which, when translated into a Set of symbolized Premisses, furnishes the very same <em>Data</em> as were furnished by the Problem of the “Five Liars.”"

We have <em>three</em> singular nouns, in English, of plural <em>form</em>, “series”, “species”, and “Sorites”: in all three, the awkwardness, of using the same word for both singular and plural, must often have been felt: this has been remedied, in the case of “series” by coining the plural “serieses”, which has already found it way into the dictionaries: so I am no rash innovator, but am merely “following suit”, in using the new plural “Soriteses”."

Some people, I know, make a practice of looking into Vol. III first, just to see how the story ends: and perhaps it <em>is</em> as well just to know that all ends <em>happily_——that the much-persecuted lovers _do</em> marry after all, that he is proved to be quite innocent of the murder, that the wicked cousin is completely foiled in his plot and gets the punishment he deserves, and that the rich uncle in India (<em>Qu.</em> Why in <em>India</em>? <em>Ans.</em> Because, somehow, uncles never <em>can</em> get rich anywhere else dies at exactly the right moment——before taking the trouble to read Vol. I. This, I say, is <em>just</em> permissible with a <em>novel</em>, where Vol. III has a <em>meaning</em>, even for those who have not read the earlier part of the story; but, with a <em>scientific</em> book, it is sheer insanity: you will find the latter part <em>hopelessly</em> unintelligible, if you read it before reaching it in regular course."
