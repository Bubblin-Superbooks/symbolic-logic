<p>PREFACE TO THE FOURTH EDITION.</p>
<p>The chief alterations, since the First Edition, have been made in the Chapter on ‘Classification’. The chief additions have been the questions on words and phrases, added to the Examination-Papers at , and the Notes inserted at the end.</p>
<p>In Book I, Chapter II, I have adopted a new definition of ‘Classification’, which enables me to regard the whole Universe as a ‘Class,’ and thus to dispense with the very awkward phrase ‘a Set of Things.’</p>
<p>In the Chapter on ‘Propositions of Existence’ I have adopted a new ‘normal form,’ in which the Class, whose existence is affirmed or denied, is regarded as the <em>Predicate</em>, instead of the <em>Subject</em>, of the Proposition, thus evading a very subtle difficulty which besets the other form. These subtle difficulties seem to lie at the root of every Tree of Knowledge, and they are <em>far</em> more hopeless to grapple with than any that occur in its higher branches. For example, the difficulties of the Forty-Seventh Proposition of Euclid are mere child’s play compared with the mental torture endured in the effort to think out the essential nature of a straight Line. And, in the present work, the difficulties of the “5 Liars” Problem, at , are “trifles, light as air,” compared with the bewildering question “What is a Thing?”</p>
<p>In the Chapter on ‘Propositions of Relation’ I have inserted a new Section, containing the proof that a Proposition, beginning with “All,” is a <em>Double</em> Proposition (a fact that is quite independent of the arbitrary rule, laid down in the next Section, that such a Proposition is to be understood as implying the actual <em>existence</em> of its Subject). This proof was given, in the earlier editions, incidentally, in the course of the discussion of the Biliteral Diagram: but its <em>proper</em> place, in this treatise, is where I have now introduced it.</p>
<p>In the Sorites-Examples, I have made a good many verbal alterations, in order to evade a difficulty, which I fear will have perplexed some of the Readers of the first three Editions. Some of the Premisses were so worded that their Terms were not Specieses of the Univ. named in the Dictionary, but of a larger Class, of which the Univ. was only a portion. In all such cases, it was intended that the Reader should perceive that what was asserted of the larger Class was thereby asserted of the Univ., and should ignore, as superfluous, all that it asserted of its <em>other</em> portion. Thus, in Ex. 15, the Univ. was stated to be “ducks in this village,” and the third Premiss was “Mrs. Bond has no gray ducks,” i.e. “No gray ducks are ducks belonging to Mrs. Bond.” Here the Terms are <em>not</em> Specieses of the Univ., but of the larger Class “ducks,” of which the Univ. is only a portion: and it was intended that the Reader should perceive that what is here asserted of “ ducks” is thereby asserted of “ ducks in this village.” and should treat this Premiss as if it were “Mrs. Bond has no gray ducks in this village,” and should ignore, as superfluous, what it asserts as to the <em>other</em> portion of the Class “ducks,” viz. “ Mrs. Bond has no gray ducks <em>out of</em> this village”.</p>
<p>In the Appendix I have given a new version of the Problem of the “Five Liars.” My object, in doing so, is to escape the subtle and mysterious difficulties which beset all attempts at regarding a Proposition as being its own Subject, or a Set of Propositions as being Subjects for one another. It is certainly, a most bewildering and unsatisfactory theory: one cannot help feeling that there is a great lack of <em>substance</em> in all this shadowy host——that, as the procession of phantoms glides before us, there is not <em>one</em> that we can pounce upon, and say “<em>Here</em> is a Proposition that <em>must</em> be either true or false!”——that it is but a Barmecide Feast, to which we have been bidden——and that its prototype is to be found in that mythical island, whose inhabitants “earned a precarious living by taking in each others’ washing”! By simply translating “telling 2 Truths” into “taking <em>both</em> of 2 condiments (salt and mustard),” “telling 2 Lies” into “taking <em>neither</em> of them” and “telling a Truth and a Lie (order not specified)” into “taking only <em>one</em> condiment (it is not specified <em>which</em>),” I have escaped all those metaphysical puzzles, and have produced a Problem which, when translated into a Set of symbolized Premisses, furnishes the very same <em>Data</em> as were furnished by the Problem of the “Five Liars.”</p>
<p>The coined words, introduced in previous editions, such as “Eliminands” and “Retinends”, perhaps hardly need any apology: they were indispensable to my system: but the new plural, here used for the first time, viz. “Soriteses”, will, I fear, be condemned as “bad English”, unless I say a word in its defence. We have <em>three</em> singular nouns, in English, of plural <em>form</em>, “series”, “species”, and “Sorites”: in all three, the awkwardness, of using the same word for both singular and plural, must often have been felt: this has been remedied, in the case of “series” by coining the plural “serieses”, which has already found it way into the dictionaries: so I am no rash innovator, but am merely “following suit”, in using the new plural “Soriteses”.</p>
<p>In conclusion, let me point out that even those, who are obliged to study <em>Formal</em> Logic, with a view to being able to answer Examination-Papers in that subject, will find the study of <em>Symbolic</em> Logic most helpful for this purpose, in throwing light upon many of the obscurities with which Formal Logic abounds, and in furnishing a delightfully easy method of <em>testing</em> the results arrived at by the cumbrous processes which Formal Logic enforces upon its votaries.</p>
<p>This is, I believe, the very first attempt (with the exception of my own little book, <em>The Game of Logic</em>, published in 1886, a very incomplete performance that has been made to <em>popularise</em> this fascinating subject. It has cost me <em>years</em> of hard work: but if it should prove, as I hope it may, to be of <em>real</em> service to the young, and to be taken up, in High Schools and in private families, as a valuable addition to their stock of healthful mental recreations, such a result would more than repay ten times the labour that I have expended on it.</p>

<p>INTRODUCTION.</p>
<hr>
<h4><em>TO LEARNERS.</em></h4>
<p>The Learner, who wishes to try the question <em>fairly</em>, whether this little book does, or does not, supply the materials for a most interesting mental recreation, is <em>earnestly</em> advised to adopt the following Rules:—</p>
<p> Begin at the <em>beginning</em>, and do not allow yourself to gratify a mere idle curiosity by dipping into the book, here and there. This would very likely lead to your throwing it aside, with the remark “This is <em>much</em> too hard for me!”, and thus losing the chance of adding a very <em>large</em> item to your stock of mental delights. This Rule (of not <em>dipping</em> is very <em>desirable</em> with <em>other</em> kinds of books——such as novels, for instance, where you may easily spoil much of the enjoyment you would otherwise get from the story, by dipping into it further on, so that what the author meant to be a pleasant surprise comes to you as a matter of course. Some people, I know, make a practice of looking into Vol. III first, just to see how the story ends: and perhaps it <em>is</em> as well just to know that all ends <em>happily_——that the much-persecuted lovers _do</em> marry after all, that he is proved to be quite innocent of the murder, that the wicked cousin is completely foiled in his plot and gets the punishment he deserves, and that the rich uncle in India (<em>Qu.</em> Why in <em>India</em>? <em>Ans.</em> Because, somehow, uncles never <em>can</em> get rich anywhere else dies at exactly the right moment——before taking the trouble to read Vol. I. This, I say, is <em>just</em> permissible with a <em>novel</em>, where Vol. III has a <em>meaning</em>, even for those who have not read the earlier part of the story; but, with a <em>scientific</em> book, it is sheer insanity: you will find the latter part <em>hopelessly</em> unintelligible, if you read it before reaching it in regular course.</p>
<p> Don’t begin any fresh Chapter, or Section, until you are certain that you <em>thoroughly</em> understand the whole book <em>up to that point</em>, and that you have worked, correctly, most if not all of the examples which have been set. So long as you are conscious that all the land you have passed through is absolutely <em>conquered</em>, and that you are leaving no unsolved difficulties <em>behind</em> you, which will be sure to turn up again later on, your triumphal progress will be easy and delightful. Otherwise, you will find your state of puzzlement get worse and worse as you proceed, till you give up the whole thing in utter disgust.  </p>
<p> When you come to any passage you don’t understand, <em>read it again</em>: if you <em>still</em> don’t understand it, <em>read it again</em>: if you fail, even after <em>three</em> readings, very likely your brain is getting a little tired. In that case, put the book away, and take to other occupations, and next day, when you come to it fresh, you will very likely find that it is <em>quite</em> easy. </p>
<p> If possible, find some genial friend, who will read the book along with you, and will talk over the difficulties with you. <em>Talking</em> is a wonderful smoother-over of difficulties. When <em>I</em> come upon anything——in Logic or in any other hard subject——that entirely puzzles me, I find it a capital plan to talk it over, <em>aloud</em>, even when I am all alone. One can explain things so <em>clearly</em> to one’s self! And then, you know, one is so <em>patient</em> with one’s self: one <em>never</em> gets irritated at one’s own stupidity!  </p>
<p>If, dear Reader, you will faithfully observe these Rules, and so give my little book a really <em>fair</em> trial, I promise you, most confidently, that you will find Symbolic Logic to be one of the most, if not <em>the</em> most, fascinating of mental recreations! In this First Part, I have carefully avoided all difficulties which seemed to me to be beyond the grasp of an intelligent child of (say twelve or fourteen years of age. I have myself taught most of its contents, <em>vivâ voce</em>, to <em>many</em> children, and have found them take a real intelligent interest in the subject. For those, who succeed in mastering Part I, and who begin, like Oliver, “asking for more,” I hope to provide, in Part II, some <em>tolerably</em> hard nuts to crack——nuts that will require all the nut-crackers they happen to possess!</p>
<p>Mental recreation is a thing that we all of us need for our mental health; and you may get much healthy enjoyment, no doubt, from Games, such as Back-gammon, Chess, and the new Game “Halma”. But, after all, when you have made yourself a first-rate player at any one of these Games, you have nothing real to <em>show</em> for it, as a <em>result!</em> You enjoyed the Game, and the victory, no doubt, <em>at the time</em>: but you have no <em>result</em> that you can treasure up and get real <em>good</em> out of. And, all the while, you have been leaving unexplored a perfect <em>mine</em> of wealth. Once master the machinery of Symbolic Logic, and you have a mental occupation always at hand, of absorbing interest, and one that will be of real <em>use</em> to you in <em>any</em> subject you may take up. It will give you clearness of thought——the ability to <em>see your way</em> through a puzzle——the habit of arranging your ideas in an orderly and get-at-able form——and, more valuable than all, the power to detect <em>fallacies</em>, and to tear to pieces the flimsy illogical arguments, which you will so continually encounter in books, in newspapers, in speeches, and even in sermons, and which so easily delude those who have never taken the trouble to master this fascinating Art. </p>
<p><em>Try it.</em> </p>
<p>That is all I ask of you!</p>
<p>\–L. C.</p>

<h4>THINGS AND THEIR ATTRIBUTES.</h4>
<h4>CHAPTER I.</h4>
<h5><em>INTRODUCTORY.</em></h5>
<p>The Universe contains ‘Things.’</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For example, “I,” “London,” “roses,” “redness,” “old English books,” “the letter which I received yesterday.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Things have ‘Attributes.’</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For example, “large,” “red,” “old,” “which I received yesterday.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>One Thing may have many Attributes; and one Attribute may belong to many Things.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Thus, the Thing “a rose” may have the Attributes “red,” “scented,” “full-blown,” &amp;c.; and the Attribute “red” may belong to the Things “a rose,” “a brick,” “a ribbon,” &amp;c.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Any Attribute, or any Set of Attributes, may be called an ‘Adjunct.’</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This word is introduced in order to avoid the constant repetition of the phrase “Attribute or Set of Attributes.”
Thus, we may say that a rose has the Attribute “red” (or the Adjunct “red,” whichever we prefer); or we may say that it has the Adjunct “red, scented and full-blown.”</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<h4>½CHAPTER II.</h4>
<h5><em>CLASSIFICATION.</em></h5>
<p>‘Classification,’ or the formation of Classes, is a Mental Process, in which we imagine that we have put together, in a group, certain Things. Such a group is called a ‘Class.’</p>
<p>This Process may be performed in three different ways, as follows:—</p>
<p>  We may imagine that we have put together all Things. The Class so formed (i.e. the Class “Things” contains the whole Universe.</p>
<p>  We may think of the Class “Things,” and may imagine that we have picked out from it all the Things which possess a certain Adjunct <em>not</em> possessed by the whole Class. This Adjunct is said to be ‘peculiar’ to the Class so formed. In this case, the Class “Things” is called a ‘Genus’ with regard to the Class so formed: the Class, so formed, is called a ‘Species’ of the Class “Things”: and its peculiar Adjunct is called its ‘Differentia’.</p>
<p>As this Process is entirely <em>Mental</em>, we can perform it whether there <em>is</em>, or <em>is not</em>, an <em>existing</em> Thing which possesses that Adjunct. If there <em>is</em>, the Class is said to be ‘Real’; if not, it is said to be ‘Unreal’, or ‘Imaginary.’</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For example, we may imagine that we have picked out, from the Class “Things,” all the Things which possess the Adjunct “material, artificial, consisting of houses and streets”; and we may thus form the Real Class “towns.” Here we may regard “Things” as a <em>Genus</em>, “Towns” as a <em>Species</em> of Things, and “material, artificial, consisting of houses and streets” as its <em>Differentia</em>.
Again, we may imagine that we have picked out all the Things which possess the Adjunct “weighing a ton, easily lifted by a baby”; and we may thus form the <em>Imaginary</em> Class “Things that weigh a ton and are easily lifted by a baby.”</p>
<ul>
<li>We may think of a certain Class, <em>not</em> the Class “Things,” and may imagine that we have picked out from it all the Members of it which possess a certain Adjunct <em>not</em> possessed by the whole Class. This Adjunct is said to be ‘peculiar’ to the smaller Class so formed. In this case, the Class thought of is called a ‘Genus’ with regard to the smaller Class picked out from it: the smaller Class is called a ‘Species’ of the larger: and its peculiar Adjunct is called its ‘Differentia’.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>For example, we may think of the Class “towns,” and imagine that we have picked out from it all the towns which possess the Attribute “lit with gas”; and we may thus form the Real Class “towns lit with gas.” Here we may regard “Towns” as a <em>Genus</em>, “Towns lit with gas” as a <em>Species</em> of Towns, and “lit with gas” as its <em>Differentia</em>.
If, in the above example, we were to alter “lit with gas” into “paved with gold,” we should get the <em>Imaginary</em> Class “towns paved with gold.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A Class, containing only <em>one</em> Member is called an ‘Individual.’</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For example, the Class “towns having four million inhabitants,” which Class contains only <em>one</em> Member, viz. “London.”
½Hence, any single Thing, which we can name so as to distinguish it from all other Things, may be regarded as a one-Member Class.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Thus “London” may be regarded as the one-Member Class, picked out from the Class “towns,” which has, as its Differentia, “having four million inhabitants.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A Class, containing two or more Members, is sometimes regarded as <em>one single Thing</em>. When so regarded, it may possess an Adjunct which is <em>not</em> possessed by any Member of it taken separately.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Thus, the Class “The soldiers of the Tenth Regiment,” when regarded as <em>one single Thing</em>, may possess the Attribute “formed in square,” which is <em>not</em> possessed by any Member of it taken separately.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<h4>CHAPTER III.</h4>
<h5><em>DIVISION.</em></h5>
<h6>§ 1.</h6>
<h6><em>Introductory.</em></h6>
<p>‘Division’ is a Mental Process, in which we think of a certain Class of Things, and imagine that we have divided it into two or more smaller Classes.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Thus, we might think of the Class “books,” and imagine that we had divided it into the two smaller Classes “bound books” and “unbound books,” or into the three Classes, “books priced at less than a shilling,” “shilling-books,” “books priced at more than a shilling,” or into the twenty-six Classes, “books whose names begin with <em>A</em>,” “books whose names begin with <em>B</em>,” &amp;c.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A Class, that has been obtained by a certain Division, is said to be ‘codivisional’ with every Class obtained by that Division.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Thus, the Class “bound books” is codivisional with each of the two Classes, “bound books” and “unbound books.”
Similarly, the Battle of Waterloo may be said to have been “contemporary” with every event that happened in 1815.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hence a Class, obtained by Division, is codivisional with itself.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Thus, the Class “bound books” is codivisional with itself.
Similarly, the Battle of Waterloo may be said to have been “contemporary” with itself.</p>
</blockquote>
<h5>½§ 2.</h5>
<h6><em>Dichotomy.</em></h6>
<p>If we think of a certain Class, and imagine that we have picked out from it a certain smaller Class, it is evident that the <em>Remainder</em> of the large Class does <em>not</em> possess the Differentia of that smaller Class. Hence it may be regarded as <em>another</em> smaller Class, whose Differentia may be formed, from that of the Class first picked out, by prefixing the word “not”; and we may imagine that we have <em>divided</em> the Class first thought of into <em>two</em> smaller Classes, whose Differentiæ are <em>contradictory</em>. This kind of Division is called ‘Dichotomy’.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For example, we may divide “books” into the two Classes whose Differentiæ are “old” and “not-old.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In performing this Process, we may sometimes find that the Attributes we have chosen are used so loosely, in ordinary conversation, that it is not easy to decide <em>which</em> of the Things belong to the one Class and <em>which</em> to the other. In such a case, it would be necessary to lay down some arbitrary <em>rule</em>, as to <em>where</em> the one Class should end and the other begin.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Thus, in dividing “books” into “old” and “not-old,” we may say “Let all books printed before a.d. 1801, be regarded as ‘old,’ and all others as ‘not-old’.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Henceforwards let it be understood that, if a Class of Things be divided into two Classes, whose Differentiæ have contrary meanings, each Differentia is to be regarded as equivalent to the other with the word “not” prefixed.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Thus, if “books” be divided into “old” and “new” the Attribute “old” is to be regarded as equivalent to “not-new,” and the Attribute “new” as equivalent to “not-old.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>After dividing a Class, by the Process of <em>Dichotomy</em>, into two smaller Classes, we may sub-divide each of these into two still smaller Classes; and this Process may be repeated over and over again, the number of Classes being doubled at each repetition.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For example, we may divide “books” into “old” and “new” (i.e. “<em>not_-old”): we may then sub-divide each of these into “English” and “foreign” (i.e. “_not_-English”), thus getting _four</em> Classes, viz.
  old English;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>  old foreign;</p>
<p>  new English;</p>
<p>  new foreign.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If we had begun by dividing into “English” and “foreign,” and had then sub-divided into “old” and “new,” the four Classes would have been
  English old;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>  English new;</p>
<p>  foreign old;</p>
<p>  foreign new.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Reader will easily see that these are the very same four Classes which we had before.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<h4>½CHAPTER IV.</h4>
<h5><em>NAMES.</em></h5>
<p>The word “Thing”, which conveys the idea of a Thing, <em>without</em> any idea of an Adjunct, represents <em>any</em> single Thing. Any other word (or phrase), which conveys the idea of a Thing, <em>with</em> the idea of an Adjunct represents <em>any</em> Thing which possesses that Adjunct; i.e., it represents any Member of the Class to which that Adjunct is <em>peculiar</em>.</p>
<p>Such a word (or phrase is called a ‘Name’; and, if there be an existing Thing which it represents, it is said to be a Name of that Thing.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For example, the words “Thing,” “Treasure,” “Town,” and the phrases “valuable Thing,” “material artificial Thing consisting of houses and streets,” “Town lit with gas,” “Town paved with gold,” “old English Book.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Just as a Class is said to be <em>Real</em>, or <em>Unreal</em>, according as there <em>is</em>, or <em>is not</em>, an existing Thing in it, so also a Name is said to be <em>Real</em>, or <em>Unreal</em>, according as there <em>is</em>, or <em>is not</em>, an existing Thing represented by it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Thus, “Town lit with gas” is a <em>Real</em> Name: “Town paved with gold” is an <em>Unreal</em> Name.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Every Name is either a Substantive only, or else a phrase consisting of a Substantive and one or more Adjectives (or phrases used as Adjectives).</p>
<p>Every Name, except “Thing”, may usually be expressed in three different forms:—</p>
<p><em>a</em> The Substantive “Thing”, and one or more Adjectives (or phrases used as Adjectives conveying the ideas of the Attributes;</p>
<p><em>b</em> A Substantive, conveying the idea of a Thing with the ideas of <em>some</em> of the Attributes, and one or more Adjectives (or phrases used as Adjectives conveying the ideas of the <em>other</em> Attributes;</p>
<p><em>c</em> A Substantive conveying the idea of a Thing with the ideas of <em>all</em> the Attributes.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Thus, the phrase “material living Thing, belonging to the Animal Kingdom, having two hands and two feet” is a Name expressed in Form (<em>a</em>).
If we choose to roll up together the Substantive “Thing” and the Adjectives “material, living, belonging to the Animal Kingdom,” so as to make the new Substantive “Animal,” we get the phrase “Animal having two hands and two feet,” which is a Name (representing the same Thing as before expressed in Form (<em>b</em>).
And, if we choose to roll up the whole phrase into one word, so as to make the new Substantive “Man,” we get a Name (still representing the very same Thing expressed in Form (<em>c</em>).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A Name, whose Substantive is in the <em>plural</em> number, may be used to represent either</p>
<p>  Members of a Class, <em>regarded as separate Things</em>;</p>
<p>or (2 a whole Class, <em>regarded as one single Thing</em>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Thus, when I say “Some soldiers of the Tenth Regiment are tall,” or “The soldiers of the Tenth Regiment are brave,” I am using the Name “soldiers of the Tenth Regiment” in the <em>first</em> sense; and it is just the same as if I were to point to each of them <em>separately</em>, and to say “<em>This</em> soldier of the Tenth Regiment is tall,” “<em>That</em> soldier of the Tenth Regiment is tall,” and so on.
But, when I say “The soldiers of the Tenth Regiment are formed in square,” I am using the phrase in the <em>second</em> sense; and it is just the same as if I were to say “The <em>Tenth Regiment</em> is formed in square.”</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<h4>CHAPTER V.</h4>
<h5><em>DEFINITIONS.</em></h5>
<p>It is evident that every Member of a <em>Species</em> is <em>also</em> a Member of the <em>Genus</em> out of which that Species has been picked, and that it possesses the <em>Differentia</em> of that Species. Hence it may be represented by a Name consisting of two parts, one being a Name representing any Member of the <em>Genus</em>, and the other being the <em>Differentia</em> of that Species. Such a Name is called a ‘Definition’ of any Member of that Species, and to give it such a Name is to ‘define’ it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Thus, we may define a “Treasure” as a “valuable Thing.” In this case we regard “Things” as the <em>Genus</em>, and “valuable” as the <em>Differentia</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The following Examples, of this Process, may be taken as models for working others.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note that, in each Definition, the Substantive, representing a Member (or Members of the <em>Genus</em>, is printed in Capitals.
. Define “a Treasure.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Ans.</em> “a valuable Thing.”</p>
<p>. Define “Treasures.”</p>
<p><em>Ans.</em> “valuable Things.”</p>
<p>. Define “a Town.”</p>
<p><em>Ans.</em> “a material artificial Thing, consisting of houses and streets.”</p>
<p>. Define “Men.”</p>
<p><em>Ans.</em> “material, living Things, belonging to the Animal Kingdom, having two hands and two feet”;</p>
<p>or else</p>
<p>“Animals having two hands and two feet.”</p>
<p>. Define “London.”</p>
<p><em>Ans.</em> “the material artificial Thing, which consists of houses and streets, and has four million inhabitants”;</p>
<p>or else</p>
<p>“the Town which has four million inhabitants.”</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note that we here use the article “the” instead of “a”, because we happen to know that there is only <em>one</em> such Thing.
The Reader can set himself any number of Examples of this Process, by simply choosing the Name of any common Thing (such as “house,” “tree,” “knife”), making a Definition for it, and then testing his answer by referring to any English Dictionary.</p>

<p>Note that the word “some” is to be regarded, henceforward, as meaning “one or more.”</p>
<p>The word ‘Proposition,’ as used in ordinary conversation, may be applied to <em>any</em> word, or phrase, which conveys any information whatever.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Thus the words “yes” and “no” are Propositions in the ordinary sense of the word; and so are the phrases “you owe me five farthings” and “I don’t!”
Such words as “oh!” or “never!”, and such phrases as “fetch me that book!” “which book do you mean?” do not seem, at first sight, to convey any <em>information</em>; but they can easily be turned into equivalent forms which do so, viz. “I am surprised,” “I will never consent to it,” “I order you to fetch me that book,” “I want to know which book you mean.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But a ‘Proposition,’ as used in this First Part of “Symbolic Logic,” has a peculiar form, which may be called its ‘Normal</p>
<p>form’; and if any Proposition, which we wish to use in an argument, is not in normal form, we must reduce it to such a form, before we can use it.</p>
<p>A ‘Proposition,’ when in normal form, asserts, as to certain two Classes, which are called its ‘Subject’ and ‘Predicate,’ either</p>
<pre><code>(1 that _some_ Members of its Subject are Members of its Predicate;</code></pre>
<p>or (2 that <em>no</em> Members of its Subject are Members of its Predicate;</p>
<p>or (3 that <em>all</em> Members of its Subject are Members of its Predicate.</p>
<p>The Subject and the Predicate of a Proposition are called its ‘Terms.’</p>
<p>Two Propositions, which convey the <em>same</em> information, are said to be ‘equivalent’.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Thus, the two Propositions, “I see John” and “John is seen by me,” are equivalent.</p>
</blockquote>
<h5>§ 2.</h5>
<h6><em>Normal form of a Proposition.</em></h6>
<p>A Proposition, in normal form, consists of four parts, viz.—</p>
<p>  The word “some,” or “no,” or “all.” (This word, which tells us <em>how many</em> Members of the Subject are also Members of the Predicate, is called the ‘Sign of Quantity.’</p>
<p>  Name of Subject.</p>
<p>  The verb “are” (or “is”). (This is called the ‘Copula.’</p>
<p>  Name of Predicate.</p>
<h5>§ 3.</h5>
<h6><em>Various kinds of Propositions.</em></h6>
<p>A Proposition, that begins with “Some”, is said to be ‘Particular.’ It is also called ‘a Proposition in I.’</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note, that it is called ‘Particular,’ because it refers to a <em>part</em> only of the Subject.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A Proposition, that begins with “No”, is said to be ‘Universal Negative.’ It is also called ‘a Proposition in E.’</p>
<p>A Proposition, that begins with “All”, is said to be ‘Universal Affirmative.’ It is also called ‘a Proposition in A.’</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note, that they are called ‘Universal’, because they refer to the <em>whole</em> of the Subject.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A Proposition, whose Subject is an <em>Individual</em>, is to be regarded as <em>Universal</em>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Let us take, as an example, the Proposition “John is not well”. This of course implies that there is an <em>Individual</em>, to whom the speaker refers when he mentions “John”, and whom the listener <em>knows</em> to be referred to. Hence the Class “men referred to by the speaker when he mentions ‘John’” is a one-Member Class, and the Proposition is equivalent to “<em>All</em> the men, who are referred to by the speaker when he mentions ‘John’, are not well.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Propositions are of two kinds, ‘Propositions of Existence’ and ‘Propositions of Relation.’</p>
<p>These shall be discussed separately.</p>
<hr>
<h4>CHAPTER II.</h4>
<h5><em>PROPOSITIONS OF EXISTENCE.</em></h5>
<p>A ‘Proposition of Existence’, when in normal form, has, for its <em>Subject</em>, the Class “existing Things”.</p>
<p>Its Sign of Quantity is “Some” or “No”.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note that, though its Sign of Quantity tells us <em>how many</em> existing Things are Members of its Predicate, it does <em>not</em> tell us the <em>exact</em> number: in fact, it only deals with <em>two</em> numbers, which are, in ascending order, “0” and “1 or more.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is called “a Proposition of Existence” because its effect is to assert the <em>Reality</em> (i.e. the real <em>existence</em>), or else the <em>Imaginariness</em>, of its Predicate.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Thus, the Proposition “Some existing Things are honest men” asserts that the Class “honest men” is <em>Real</em>.
This is the <em>normal</em> form; but it may also be expressed in any one of the following forms:—
  “Honest men exist”;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>  “Some honest men exist”;</p>
<p>  “The Class ‘honest men’ exists”;</p>
<p>  “There are honest men”;</p>
<p>  “There are some honest men”.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Similarly, the Proposition “No existing Things are men fifty feet high” asserts that the Class “men 50 feet high” is <em>Imaginary</em>.
This is the <em>normal</em> form; but it may also be expressed in any one of the following forms:—
  “Men 50 feet high do not exist”;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>  “No men 50 feet high exist”;</p>
<p>  “The Class ‘men 50 feet high’ does not exist”;</p>
<p>  “There are not any men 50 feet high”;</p>
<p>  “There are no men 50 feet high.”</p>
<hr>
<h4>CHAPTER III.</h4>
<h5><em>PROPOSITIONS OF RELATION.</em></h5>
<h5>§ 1.</h5>
<h6><em>Introductory.</em></h6>
<p>A Proposition of Relation, of the kind to be here discussed, has, for its Terms, two Specieses of the same Genus, such that each of the two Names conveys the idea of some Attribute <em>not</em> conveyed by the other.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Thus, the Proposition “Some merchants are misers” is of the right kind, since “merchants” and “misers” are Specieses of the same Genus “men”; and since the Name “merchants” conveys the idea of the Attribute “mercantile”, and the name “misers” the idea of the Attribute “miserly”, each of which ideas is <em>not</em> conveyed by the other Name.
But the Proposition “Some dogs are setters” is <em>not</em> of the right kind, since, although it is true that “dogs” and “setters” are Specieses of the same Genus “animals”, it is <em>not</em> true that the Name “dogs” conveys the idea of any Attribute not conveyed by the Name “setters”. Such Propositions will be discussed in Part II.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Genus, of which the two Terms are Specieses, is called the ‘Universe of Discourse,’ or (more briefly the ‘Univ.’</p>
<p>The Sign of Quantity is “Some” or “No” or “All”.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note that, though its Sign of Quantity tells us <em>how many</em> Members of its Subject are <em>also</em> Members of its Predicate, it does not tell us the <em>exact</em> number: in fact, it only deals with <em>three</em> numbers, which are, in ascending order, “0”, “1 or more”, “the total number of Members of the Subject”.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is called “a Proposition of Relation” because its effect is to assert that a certain <em>relationship</em> exists between its Terms.</p>
<h5>§ 2.</h5>
<h6><em>Reduction of a Proposition of Relation to Normal form.</em></h6>
<p>The Rules, for doing this, are as follows:—</p>
<p>  Ascertain what is the <em>Subject</em> (i.e., ascertain what Class we are <em>talking about</em>);</p>
<p>  If the verb, governed by the Subject, is <em>not</em> the verb “are” (or “is”), substitute for it a phrase beginning with “are” (or “is”);</p>
<p>  Ascertain what is the <em>Predicate</em> (i.e., ascertain what Class it is, which is asserted to contain <em>some</em>, or <em>none</em>, or <em>all</em>, of the Members of the Subject);</p>
<p>  If the Name of each Term is <em>completely expressed</em> (i.e. if it contains a Substantive), there is no need to determine the ‘Univ.’; but, if either Name is <em>incompletely expressed</em>, and contains <em>Attributes</em> only, it is then necessary to determine a ‘Univ.’, in order to insert its Name as the Substantive.</p>
<p>  Ascertain the <em>Sign of Quantity</em>;</p>
<p>  Arrange in the following order:—</p>
<p>Sign of Quantity,<br>Subject,<br>Copula,<br>Predicate.  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Let us work a few Examples, to illustrate these Rules.
“Some apples are not ripe.”
  The Subject is “apples.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>  The Verb is “are.”</p>
<p>  The Predicate is “not-ripe \ \ .” (As no Substantive is expressed, and we have not yet settled what the Univ. is to be, we are forced to leave a blank.</p>
<p>  Let Univ. be “fruit.”</p>
<p>  The Sign of Quantity is “some.”</p>
<p>  The Proposition now becomes</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Some | apples | are | not-ripe fruit.”
“None of my speculations have brought me as much as 5 per cent.”
  The Subject is “my speculations.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>  The Verb is “have brought,” for which we substitute the phrase “are \ \ \ that have brought”.</p>
<p>  The Predicate is “\ \ \ that have brought &amp;c.”</p>
<p>  Let Univ. be “transactions.”</p>
<p>  The Sign of Quantity is “none of.”</p>
<p>  The Proposition now becomes</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“None of | my speculations | are | transactions that have brought me as much as 5 per cent.”
“None but the brave deserve the fair.”
To begin with, we note that the phrase “none but the brave” is equivalent to “no <em>not_-brave.”
  The Subject has for its _Attribute</em> “not-brave.” But no <em>Substantive</em> is supplied. So we express the Subject as “not-brave \ \ .”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>  The Verb is “deserve,” for which we substitute the phrase “are deserving of”.</p>
<p>  The Predicate is “\ \ \ deserving of the fair.”</p>
<p>  Let Univ. be “persons.”</p>
<p>  The Sign of Quantity is “no.”</p>
<p>  The Proposition now becomes</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“No | not-brave persons | are | persons deserving of the fair.”
“A lame puppy would not say “thank you” if you offered to lend it a skipping-rope.”
  The Subject is evidently “lame puppies,” and all the rest of the sentence must somehow be packed into the Predicate.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>  The Verb is “would not say,” &amp;c., for which we may substitute the phrase “are not grateful for.”</p>
<p>  The Predicate may be expressed as “\ \ \ not grateful for the loan of a skipping-rope.”</p>
<p>  Let Univ. be “puppies.”</p>
<p>  The Sign of Quantity is “all.”</p>
<p>  The Proposition now becomes</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“All | lame puppies | are | puppies not grateful for the loan of a skipping-rope.”
“No one takes in the <em>Times</em>, unless he is well-educated.”
  The Subject is evidently persons who are not well-educated (“no _one_” evidently means “no _person_”).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>  The Verb is “takes in,” for which we may substitute the phrase “are persons taking in.”</p>
<p>  The Predicate is “persons taking in the <em>Times</em>.”</p>
<p>  Let Univ. be “persons.”</p>
<p>  The Sign of Quantity is “no.”</p>
<p>  The Proposition now becomes</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“No | persons who are not well-educated | are | persons taking in the <em>Times</em>.”
“My carriage will meet you at the station.”
  The Subject is “my carriage.” This, being an ‘Individual,’ is equivalent to the Class “my carriages.” (Note that this Class contains only <em>one</em> Member.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>  The Verb is “will meet”, for which we may substitute the phrase “are \ \ \ that will meet.”</p>
<p>  The Predicate is “\ \ \ that will meet you at the station.”</p>
<p>  Let Univ. be “things.”</p>
<p>  The Sign of Quantity is “all.”</p>
<p>  The Proposition now becomes</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“All | my carriages | are | things that will meet you at the station.”
“Happy is the man who does not know what ‘toothache’ means!”
  The Subject is evidently “the man &amp;c.” (Note that in this sentence, the <em>Predicate</em> comes first. At first sight, the Subject seems to be an ‘<em>Individual_’; but on further consideration, we see that the article “the” does _not</em> imply that there is only <em>one</em> such man. Hence the phrase “the man who” is equivalent to “all men who”.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>  The Verb is “are.”</p>
<p>  The Predicate is “happy \ \ .”</p>
<p>  Let Univ. be “men.”</p>
<p>  The Sign of Quantity is “all.”</p>
<p>  The Proposition now becomes</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“All | men who do not know what ‘toothache’ means | are | happy men.”
“Some farmers always grumble at the weather, whatever it may be.”
  The Subject is “farmers.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>  The Verb is “grumble,” for which we substitute the phrase “are \ \ \ who grumble.”</p>
<p>  The Predicate is “\ \ \ who always grumble &amp;c.”</p>
<p>  Let Univ. be “persons.”</p>
<p>  The Sign of Quantity is “some.”</p>
<p>  The Proposition now becomes</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Some | farmers | are | persons who always grumble at the weather, whatever it may be.”
“No lambs are accustomed to smoke cigars.”
  The Subject is “lambs.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>  The Verb is “are.”</p>
<p>  The Predicate is “\ \ \ accustomed &amp;c.”</p>
<p>  Let Univ. be “animals.”</p>
<p>  The Sign of Quantity is “no.”</p>
<p>  The Proposition now becomes</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“No | lambs | are | animals accustomed to smoke cigars.”
“I ca’n’t understand examples that are not arranged in regular order, like those I am used to.”
  The Subject is “examples that,” &amp;c.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>  The Verb is “I ca’n’t understand,” which we must alter, so as to have “examples,” instead of “I,” as the nominative case. It may be expressed as “are not understood by me.”</p>
<p>  The Predicate is “\ \ \ not understood by me.”</p>
<p>  Let Univ. be “examples.”</p>
<p>  The Sign of Quantity is “all.”</p>
<p>  The Proposition now becomes</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“All | examples that are not arranged in regular order like those I am used to | are | examples not understood by me.”</p>
</blockquote>
<h5>§ 3.</h5>
<h6><em>A Proposition of Relation, beginning with “All”, is a Double Proposition.</em></h6>
<p>A Proposition of Relation, beginning with “All”, asserts (as we already know that “<em>All</em> Members of the Subject are Members of the Predicate”. This evidently contains, as a <em>part</em> of what it tells us, the smaller Proposition “<em>Some</em> Members of the Subject are Members of the Predicate”.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Thus, the Proposition “<em>All</em> bankers are rich men” evidently contains the smaller Proposition “<em>Some</em> bankers are rich men”.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The question now arises “What is the <em>rest</em> of the information which this Proposition gives us?”</p>
<p>In order to answer this question, let us begin with the smaller Proposition, “<em>Some</em> Members of the Subject are Members of the Predicate,” and suppose that this is <em>all</em> we have been told; and let us proceed to inquire what <em>else</em> we need to be told, in order to know that “<em>All</em> Members of the Subject are Members of the Predicate”.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Thus, we may suppose that the Proposition “<em>Some</em> bankers are rich men” is all the information we possess; and we may proceed to inquire what <em>other</em> Proposition needs to be added to it, in order to make up the entire Proposition “<em>All</em> bankers are rich men”.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Let us also suppose that the ‘Univ.’ (i.e. the Genus, of which both the Subject and the Predicate are Specieses has been divided (by the Process of <em>Dichotomy</em> into two smaller Classes, viz.</p>
<p>  the Predicate;</p>
<p>  the Class whose Differentia is <em>contradictory</em> to that of the Predicate.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Thus, we may suppose that the Genus “men,” (of which both “bankers” and “rich men” are Specieses has been divided into the two smaller Classes, “rich men”, “poor men”.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now we know that <em>every</em> Member of the Subject is (as shown at  p. 6 a Member of the Univ. Hence <em>every</em> Member of the Subject is either in Class (1 or else in Class (2).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Thus, we know that <em>every</em> banker is a Member of the Genus “men”. Hence, <em>every</em> banker is either in the Class “rich men”, or else in the Class “poor men”.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Also we have been told that, in the case we are discussing, <em>some</em> Members of the Subject are in Class (1). What <em>else</em> do we need to be told, in order to know that <em>all</em> of them are there? Evidently we need to be told that <em>none</em> of them are in Class (2); i.e. that <em>none</em> of them are Members of the Class whose Differentia is <em>contradictory</em> to that of the Predicate.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Thus, we may suppose we have been told that <em>some</em> bankers are in the Class “rich men”. What <em>else</em> do we need to be told, in order to know that <em>all</em> of them are there? Evidently we need to be told that <em>none</em> of them are in the Class “<em>poor</em> men”.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hence a Proposition of Relation, beginning with “All”, is a <em>Double</em> Proposition, and is ‘equivalent’ to (i.e. gives the same information as the <em>two</em> Propositions</p>
<p>  “<em>Some</em> Members of the Subject are Members of the Predicate”;</p>
<p>  “<em>No</em> Members of the Subject are Members of the Class whose Differentia is <em>contradictory</em> to that of the Predicate”.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Thus, the Proposition “<em>All</em> bankers are rich men” is a <em>Double</em> Proposition, and is equivalent to the <em>two</em> Propositions
  “<em>Some</em> bankers are rich men”;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>  “<em>No</em> bankers are <em>poor</em> men”.</p>
<h5>§ 4.</h5>
<h6><em>What is implied, in a Proposition of Relation, as to the Reality of its Terms?</em></h6>
<p>Note that the rules, here laid down, are <em>arbitrary</em>, and only apply to Part I of my “Symbolic Logic.”</p>
<p>A Proposition of Relation, beginning with “Some”, is henceforward to be understood as asserting that there are <em>some existing Things</em>, which, being Members of the Subject, are also Members of the Predicate; i.e. that <em>some existing Things</em> are Members of <em>both</em> Terms at once. Hence it is to be understood as implying that <em>each</em> Term, taken by itself, is <em>Real</em>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Thus, the Proposition “Some rich men are invalids” is to be understood as asserting that <em>some existing Things</em> are “rich invalids”. Hence it implies that <em>each</em> of the two Classes, “rich men” and “invalids”, taken by itself, is <em>Real</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A Proposition of Relation, beginning with “No”, is henceforward to be understood as asserting that there are <em>no existing Things</em> which, being Members of the Subject, are also Members of the Predicate; i.e. that <em>no existing Things</em> are Members of <em>both</em> Terms at once. But this implies nothing as to the <em>Reality</em> of either Term taken by itself.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Thus, the Proposition “No mermaids are milliners” is to be understood as asserting that <em>no existing Things</em> are “mermaid-milliners”. But this implies nothing as to the <em>Reality</em>, or the <em>Unreality</em>, of either of the two Classes, “mermaids” and “milliners”, taken by itself. In this case as it happens, the Subject is <em>Imaginary</em>, and the Predicate <em>Real</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A Proposition of Relation, beginning with “All”, contains (see  § 3 a similar Proposition beginning with “Some”. Hence it is to be understood as implying that <em>each</em> Term, taken by itself, is <em>Real</em>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Thus, the Proposition “All hyænas are savage animals” contains the Proposition “Some hyænas are savage animals”. Hence it implies that <em>each</em> of the two Classes, “hyænas” and “savage animals”, taken by itself, is <em>Real</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<h5>§ 5.</h5>
<h6><em>Translation of a Proposition of Relation into one or more Propositions of Existence.</em></h6>
<p>We have seen that a Proposition of Relation, beginning with “Some,” asserts that <em>some existing Things</em>, being Members of its Subject, are <em>also</em> Members of its Predicate. Hence, it asserts that some existing Things are Members of <em>both</em>; i.e. it asserts that some existing Things are Members of the Class of Things which have <em>all</em> the Attributes of the Subject and the Predicate.</p>
<p>Hence, to translate it into a Proposition of Existence, we take “existing Things” as the new <em>Subject</em>, and Things, which have <em>all</em> the Attributes of the Subject and the Predicate, as the new Predicate.</p>
<p>Similarly for a Proposition of Relation beginning with “No”.</p>
<p>A Proposition of Relation, beginning with “All”, is (as shown in  § 3 equivalent to <em>two</em> Propositions, one beginning with “Some” and the other with “No”, each of which we now know how to translate.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Let us work a few Examples, to illustrate these Rules.
“Some apples are not ripe.”
Here we arrange thus:—
“Some”</p>
<p><em>Sign of Quantity</em>.
“existing Things”</p>
<p><em>Subject</em>.
“are”</p>
<p><em>Copula</em>.
“not-ripe apples”</p>
<p><em>Predicate</em>.
or thus:—
“Some | existing Things | are | not-ripe apples.”
“Some farmers always grumble at the weather, whatever it may be.”
Here we arrange thus:—
“Some | existing Things | are | farmers who always grumble at the weather, whatever it may be.”
“No lambs are accustomed to smoke cigars.”
Here we arrange thus:—
“No | existing Things |are | lambs accustomed to smoke cigars.”
“None of my speculations have brought me as much as 5 per cent.”
Here we arrange thus:—
“No | existing Things | are | speculations of mine, which have brought me as much as 5 per cent.”
“None but the brave deserve the fair.”
Here we note, to begin with, that the phrase “none but the brave” is equivalent to “no not-brave men.” We then arrange thus:—
“No | existing Things | are | not-brave men deserving of the fair.”
“All bankers are rich men.”
This is equivalent to the two Propositions “Some bankers are rich men” and “No bankers are poor men.”
Here we arrange thus:—
“Some | existing Things | are | rich bankers”; and “No | existing Things | are | poor bankers.”

<h4>THE BILITERAL DIAGRAM.</h4>


<img class="overlay" width="100%" height="100%" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marvindanig/symbolic-logic/master/assets/images/b3c1d01.png" alt="An annotated biliteral diagram">
<hr>
<h4>CHAPTER I.</h4>
<h5><em>SYMBOLS AND CELLS.</em></h5>
<p>First, let us suppose that the above Diagram is an enclosure assigned to a certain Class of Things, which we have selected as our ‘Universe of Discourse.’ or, more briefly, as our ‘Univ’.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For example, we might say “Let Univ. be ‘books’”; and we might imagine the Diagram to be a large table, assigned to all “books.”
The Reader is strongly advised, in reading this Chapter, <em>not</em> to refer to the above Diagram, but to draw a large one for himself, <em>without any letters</em>, and to have it by him while he reads, and keep his finger on that particular <em>part</em> of it, about which he is reading.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Secondly, let us suppose that we have selected a certain Adjunct, which we may call “<em>x</em>,” and have divided the large Class, to which we have assigned the whole Diagram, into the two smaller Classes whose Differentiæ are “<em>x</em>” and “not-<em>x</em>” (which we may call “<em>x′_”), and that we have assigned the _North</em> Half of the Diagram to the one (which we may call “the Class of <em>x</em>-Things,” or “the <em>x</em>-Class”), and the <em>South</em> Half to the other (which we may call “the Class of _x′_-Things,” or “the _x′_-Class”).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For example, we might say “Let <em>x</em> mean ‘old,’ so that <em>x′</em> will mean ‘new’,” and we might suppose that we had divided books into the two Classes whose Differentiæ are “old” and “new,” and had assigned the <em>North</em> Half of the table to “<em>old</em> books” and the <em>South</em> Half to “<em>new</em> books.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thirdly, let us suppose that we have selected another Adjunct, which we may call “<em>y</em>”, and have subdivided the <em>x</em>-Class into the two Classes whose Differentiæ are “<em>y</em>” and “<em>y′_”, and that we have assigned the North-_West</em> Cell to the one (which we may call “the <em>x</em>y_-Class”), and the North-<em>East</em> Cell to the other (which we may call “the <em>x</em>y′_-Class”).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For example, we might say “Let <em>y</em> mean ‘English,’ so that <em>y′</em> will mean ‘foreign’”, and we might suppose that we had subdivided “old books” into the two Classes whose Differentiæ are “English” and “foreign”, and had assigned the North-<em>West</em> Cell to “old <em>English</em> books”, and the North-<em>East</em> Cell to “old <em>foreign</em> books.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Fourthly, let us suppose that we have subdivided the <em>x′_-Class in the same manner, and have assigned the South-_West</em> Cell to the <em>x′<em>y</em>-Class, and the South-_East</em> Cell to the _x′_y′_-Class.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For example, we might suppose that we had subdivided “new books” into the two Classes “new <em>English</em> books” and “new <em>foreign</em> books”, and had assigned the South-<em>West</em> Cell to the one, and the South-<em>East</em> Cell to the other.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is evident that, if we had begun by dividing for <em>y</em> and <em>y′</em>, and had then subdivided for <em>x</em> and <em>x′</em>, we should have got the <em>same</em> four Classes. Hence we see that we have assigned the <em>West</em> Half to the <em>y</em>-Class, and the <em>East</em> Half to the _y′_-Class.</p>


<img class="overlay" width="100%" height="100%" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marvindanig/symbolic-logic/master/assets/images/b3c1d02.png" alt="Diagram representing books">
<blockquote>
<p>Thus, in the above Example, we should find that we had assigned the <em>West</em> Half of the table to “<em>English</em> books” and the <em>East</em> Half to “<em>foreign</em> books.”  </p>
<p>We have, in fact, assigned the four Quarters of the table to four different Classes of books, as here shown.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Reader should carefully remember that, in such a phrase as “the x-Things,” the word “Things” means that particular <em>kind</em> of Things, to which the whole Diagram has been assigned.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Thus, if we say “Let Univ. be ‘books’,” we mean that we have assigned the whole Diagram to “books.” In that case, if we took “<em>x</em>” to mean “old”, the phrase “the <em>x</em>-Things” would mean “the old books.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Reader should not go on to the next Chapter until he is <em>quite familiar</em> with the <em>blank</em> Diagram I have advised him to draw.</p>
<p>He ought to be able to name, <em>instantly</em>, the <em>Adjunct</em> assigned to any Compartment named in the right-hand column of the following Table.</p>
<p>Also he ought to be able to name, <em>instantly</em>, the <em>Compartment</em> assigned to any Adjunct named in the left-hand column.</p>
<p>To make sure of this, he had better put the book into the hands of some genial friend, while he himself has nothing but the blank Diagram, and get that genial friend to question him on this Table, <em>dodging</em> about as much as possible. The Questions and Answers should be something like this:—</p>
<p>TABLE I. </p>

<p>_ Compartments,<br> or Cells,<br> assigned to them. _</p>

<p>After a little practice, he will find himself able to do without the blank Diagram, and will be able to see it <em>mentally</em> (“in my mind’s eye, Horatio!” while answering the questions of his genial friend.

<h5><em>COUNTERS.</em></h5>
<p>Let us agree that a <em>Red</em> Counter, placed within a Cell, shall mean “This Cell is <em>occupied_” (i.e. “There is at least _one</em> Thing in it”).</p>
<p>Let us also agree that a <em>Red</em> Counter, placed on the partition between two Cells, shall mean “The Compartment, made up of these two Cells, is <em>occupied</em>; but it is not known <em>whereabouts</em>, in it, its occupants are.” Hence it may be understood to mean “At least <em>one</em> of these two Cells is occupied: possibly <em>both</em> are.”</p>
<p>Our ingenious American cousins have invented a phrase to describe the condition of a man who has not yet made up his mind <em>which</em> of two political parties he will join: such a man is said to be “sitting on the fence.” This phrase exactly describes the condition of the Red Counter.</p>
<p>Let us also agree that a <em>Grey</em> Counter, placed within a Cell, shall mean “This Cell is <em>empty_” (i.e. “There is _nothing</em> in it”).</p>

<p>The Reader had better provide himself with 4 Red Counters and 5 Grey ones.</p>

<h4>CHAPTER III.</h4>
<h5><em>REPRESENTATION OF PROPOSITIONS.</em></h5>
<h5>§ 1.</h5>
<h6><em>Introductory.</em></h6>
<p>Henceforwards, in stating such Propositions as “Some <em>x</em>-Things exist” or “No <em>x</em>-Things are <em>y</em>-Things”, I shall omit the word “Things”, which the Reader can supply for himself, and shall write them as “Some <em>x</em> exist” or “No <em>x</em> are <em>y</em>”.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A Proposition, containing only <em>one</em> of the Letters used as Symbols for Attributes, is said to be ‘Uniliteral’.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For example, “Some <em>x</em> exist”, “No <em>y′</em> exist”, &amp;c.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A Proposition, containing <em>two</em> Letters, is said to be ‘Biliteral’.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For example, “Some <em>x</em>y′_ exist”, “No <em>x′</em> are <em>y</em>”, &amp;c.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A Proposition is said to be ‘in terms of’ the Letters it contains, whether with or without accents.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Thus, “Some <em>x</em>y′_ exist”, “No <em>x′</em> are <em>y</em>”, &amp;c., are said to be <em>in terms of</em> <em>x</em> and <em>y</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<h5>§ 2.</h5>
<h6><em>Representation of Propositions of Existence.</em></h6>
<p>Let us take, first, the Proposition “Some <em>x</em> exist”.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>\ Note that this Proposition is (as explained at [p. 12 equivalent to “Some existing Things are <em>x</em>-Things.”
<img class="overlay" width="100%" height="100%" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marvindanig/symbolic-logic/master/assets/images/b3c3d01.png" alt="Diagram representing x exists"></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This tells us that there is at least <em>one</em> Thing in the North Half; that is, that the North Half is <em>occupied</em>. And this we can evidently represent by placing a <em>Red</em> Counter (here represented by a <em>dotted</em> circle on the partition which divides the North Half.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the “books” example, this Proposition would be “Some old books exist”.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Similarly we may represent the three similar Propositions “Some <em>x′</em> exist”, “Some <em>y</em> exist”, and “Some <em>y′</em> exist”.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Reader should make out all these for himself. In the “books” example, these Propositions would be “Some new books exist”, &amp;c.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Let us take, next, the Proposition “No <em>x</em> exist”.</p>


<img class="overlay" width="100%" height="100%" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marvindanig/symbolic-logic/master/assets/images/b3c3d02.png" alt="Diagram representing x does not exist">
<p>This tells us that there is <em>nothing</em> in the North Half; that is, that the North Half is <em>empty</em>; that is, that the North-West Cell and the North-East Cell are both of them <em>empty</em>. And this we can represent by placing <em>two Grey</em> Counters in the North Half, one in each Cell.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Reader may perhaps think that it would be enough to place a <em>Grey</em> Counter on the partition in the North Half, and that, just as a <em>Red</em> Counter, so placed, would mean “This Half is <em>occupied_”, so a _Grey</em> one would mean “This Half is <em>empty_”.
This, however, would be a mistake. We have seen that a _Red</em> Counter, so placed, would mean “At least <em>one</em> of these two Cells is occupied: possibly <em>both</em> are.” Hence a <em>Grey</em> one would merely mean “At least <em>one</em> of these two Cells is empty: possibly <em>both</em> are”. But what we have to represent is, that both Cells are <em>certainly</em> empty: and this can only be done by placing a <em>Grey</em> Counter in <em>each</em> of them.
In the “books” example, this Proposition would be “No old books exist”.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Similarly we may represent the three similar Propositions “No <em>x′</em> exist”, “No <em>y</em> exist”, and “No <em>y′</em> exist”.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Reader should make out all these for himself. In the “books” example, these three Propositions would be “No new books exist”, &amp;c.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Let us take, next, the Proposition “Some xy exist”.</p>


<img class="overlay" width="100%" height="100%" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marvindanig/symbolic-logic/master/assets/images/b3c3d03.png" alt="Diagram representing x y exists">
<p>This tells us that there is at least <em>one</em> Thing in the North-West Cell; that is, that the North-West Cell is <em>occupied</em>. And this we can represent by placing a <em>Red</em> Counter in it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the “books” example, this Proposition would be “Some old English books exist”.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Similarly we may represent the three similar Propositions “Some <em>x</em>y′_ exist”, “Some <em>x′_y</em> exist”, and “Some <em>x′_y′</em> exist”.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Reader should make out all these for himself. In the “books” example, these three Propositions would be “Some old foreign books exist”, &amp;c.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Let us take, next, the Proposition “No <em>x</em>y_ exist”.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>We have seen that the Proposition “No <em>x</em> exist” may be represented by placing <em>two Grey</em> Counters in the North Half, one in each Cell.</p>
<p>We have also seen that these two <em>Grey</em> Counters, taken <em>separately</em>, represent the two Propositions “No <em>x</em>y_ exist” and “No <em>x</em>y′_ exist”.</p>
<p>Hence we see that the Proposition “No <em>x</em> exist” is a <em>Double</em> Proposition, and is equivalent to the <em>two</em> Propositions “No <em>x</em>y_ exist” and “No <em>x</em>y′_ exist”.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the “books” example, this Proposition would be “No old books exist”.
Hence this is a <em>Double</em> Proposition, and is equivalent to the <em>two</em> Propositions “No old <em>English</em> books exist” and “No old <em>foreign</em> books exist”.</p>
</blockquote>
<h5>§ 3.</h5>
<h6><em>Representation of Propositions of Relation.</em></h6>
<p>Let us take, first, the Proposition “Some <em>x</em> are <em>y</em>”.</p>

<p>This tells us that at least <em>one</em> Thing, in the <em>North</em> Half, is also in the <em>West</em> Half. Hence it must be in the space <em>common</em> to them, that is, in the <em>North-West Cell</em>. Hence the North-West Cell is <em>occupied</em>. And this we can represent by placing a <em>Red</em> Counter in it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note that the <em>Subject</em> of the Proposition settles which <em>Half</em> we are to use; and that the <em>Predicate</em> settles in which <em>portion</em> of it we are to place the Red Counter.
In the “books” example, this Proposition would be “Some old books are English”.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Similarly we may represent the three similar Propositions “Some <em>x</em> are <em>y′_”, “Some _x′</em> are <em>y</em>”, and “Some <em>x′</em> are _y′_”.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Reader should make out all these for himself. In the “books” example, these three Propositions would be “Some old books are foreign”, &amp;c.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>We see that this <em>one</em> Diagram has now served to represent no less than <em>three</em> Propositions, viz.</p>
<p>  “Some <em>x</em>y_ exist;</p>
<pre><code>Some _x_ are _y_;

Some _y_ are _x_”.</code></pre>
<p>Hence these three Propositions are equivalent.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the “books” example, these Propositions would be
  “Some old English books exist;</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>Some old books are English;

Some English books are old”.</code></pre>
<p>The two equivalent Propositions, “Some <em>x</em> are <em>y</em>” and “Some <em>y</em> are <em>x</em>”, are said to be ‘Converse’ to each other; and the Process, of changing one into the other, is called ‘Converting’, or ‘Conversion’.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For example, if we were told to convert the Proposition
“Some apples are not ripe,”
we should first choose our Univ. (say “fruit”), and then complete the Proposition, by supplying the Substantive “fruit” in the Predicate, so that it would be
“Some apples are not-ripe fruit”;
and we should then convert it by interchanging its Terms, so that it would be
“Some not-ripe fruit are apples”.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Similarly we may represent the three similar Trios of equivalent Propositions; the whole Set of <em>four</em> Trios being as follows:—</p>
<p>  “Some <em>x</em>y_ exist” = “Some <em>x</em> are <em>y</em>” = “Some <em>y</em> are <em>x</em>”.</p>
<p>  “Some <em>x</em>y′_ exist” = “Some <em>x</em> are <em>y′_” = “Some _y′</em> are <em>x</em>”.</p>

<h4>CHAPTER IV.</h4>
<h5><em>INTERPRETATION OF BILITERAL DIAGRAM WHEN MARKED WITH COUNTERS.</em></h5>
<p>The Diagram is supposed to be set before us, with certain Counters placed upon it; and the problem is to find out what Proposition, or Propositions, the Counters represent.</p>
<p>As the process is simply the reverse of that discussed in the previous Chapter, we can avail ourselves of the results there obtained, as far as they go.</p>


<img class="overlay" width="100%" height="100%" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marvindanig/symbolic-logic/master/assets/images/b3c4d01.png" alt="Diagram representing x y exists">
<p>First, let us suppose that we find a <em>Red</em> Counter placed in the North-West Cell.</p>
<p>We know that this represents each of the Trio of equivalent Propositions</p>
<p>“Some <em>x</em>y_ exist” = “Some <em>x</em> are <em>y</em>” = “Some <em>y</em> are <em>x</em>”.</p>
<p>Similarly we may interpret a <em>Red</em> Counter, when placed in the North-East, or South-West, or South-East Cell.</p>


<img class="overlay" width="100%" height="100%" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marvindanig/symbolic-logic/master/assets/images/b3c4d02.png" alt="Diagram representing x y does not exist">
<p>Next, let us suppose that we find a <em>Grey</em> Counter placed in the North-West Cell.</p>
<p>We know that this represents each of the Trio of equivalent Propositions</p>
<p>“No <em>x</em>y_ exist” = “No <em>x</em> are <em>y</em>” = “No <em>y</em> are <em>x</em>”.</p>
<p>Similarly we may interpret a <em>Grey</em> Counter, when placed in the North-East, or South-West, or South-East Cell.</p>


<img class="overlay" width="100%" height="100%" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marvindanig/symbolic-logic/master/assets/images/b3c4d03.png" alt="Diagram representing x exists">
<p>Next, let us suppose that we find a <em>Red</em> Counter placed on the partition which divides the North Half.</p>
<p>We know that this represents the Proposition “Some <em>x</em> exist.”</p>
<p>Similarly we may interpret a <em>Red</em> Counter, when placed on the partition which divides the South, or West, or East Half.</p>


<img class="overlay" width="100%" height="100%" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marvindanig/symbolic-logic/master/assets/images/b3c4d04.png" alt="Diagram representing x exists with and without y">
<p>Next, let us suppose that we find <em>two Red</em> Counters placed in the North Half, one in each Cell.</p>
<p>We know that this represents the <em>Double</em> Proposition “Some <em>x</em> are <em>y</em> and some are _y′_”.</p>
<p>Similarly we may interpret <em>two Red</em> Counters, when placed in the South, or West, or East Half.</p>


<img class="overlay" width="100%" height="100%" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marvindanig/symbolic-logic/master/assets/images/b3c4d05.png" alt="Diagram representing x does not exist">
<p>Next, let us suppose that we find <em>two Grey</em> Counters placed in the North Half, one in each Cell.</p>
<p>We know that this represents the Proposition “No <em>x</em> exist”.</p>
<p>Similarly we may interpret <em>two Grey</em> Counters, when placed in the South, or West, or East Half.</p>


<img class="overlay" width="100%" height="100%" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marvindanig/symbolic-logic/master/assets/images/b3c4d06.png" alt="Diagram representing all x are y">
<p>Lastly, let us suppose that we find a <em>Red</em> and a <em>Grey</em> Counter placed in the North Half, the <em>Red</em> in the North-<em>West</em> Cell, and the <em>Grey</em> in the North-<em>East</em> Cell.</p>
<p>We know that this represents the Proposition, “All <em>x</em> are <em>y</em>”.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note that the <em>Half</em>, occupied by the two Counters, settles what is to be the <em>Subject</em> of the Proposition, and that the <em>Cell</em>, occupied by the <em>Red</em> Counter, settles what is to be its <em>Predicate</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Similarly we may interpret a <em>Red</em> and a <em>Grey</em> counter, when placed in any one of the seven similar positions</p>
<p>Red in North-East, Grey in North-West;<br>Red in South-West, Grey in South-East;<br>Red in South-East, Grey in South-West;<br>Red in North-West, Grey in South-West;<br>Red in South-West, Grey in North-West;<br>Red in North-East, Grey in South-East;<br>Red in South-East, Grey in North-East.</p>
<p>Once more the genial friend must be appealed to, and requested to examine the Reader on Tables II and III, and to make him not only <em>represent</em> Propositions, but also <em>interpret</em> Diagrams when marked with Counters.</p>
<p>The Questions and Answers should be like this:—</p>
<p>Q. Represent “No <em>x′</em> are <em>y′</em>.”<br>A. Grey Counter in S.E. Cell.<br>Q. Interpret Red Counter on E. partition.<br>A. “Some <em>y′</em> exist.”<br>Q. Represent “All <em>y′</em> are <em>x</em>.”<br>A. Red in N.E. Cell; Grey in S.E.<br>Q. Interpret Grey Counter in S.W. Cell.<br>A. “No <em>x′_y</em> exist” = “No <em>x′</em> are <em>y</em>” = “No <em>y</em> are _x′_”.  </p>
<p>At first the Examinee will need to have the Board and Counters before him; but he will soon learn to dispense with these, and to answer with his eyes shut or gazing into vacancy.</p>

<h4>CHAPTER I.</h4>
<h5><em>SYMBOLS AND CELLS.</em></h5>
<p>First, let us suppose that the above <em>left_-hand Diagram is the Biliteral Diagram that we have been using in Book III., and that we change it into a _Triliteral</em> Diagram by drawing an <em>Inner Square</em>, so as to divide each of its 4 Cells into 2 portions, thus making 8 Cells altogether. The _right_-hand Diagram shows the result.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Reader is strongly advised, in reading this Chapter, <em>not</em> to refer to the above Diagrams, but to make a large copy of the right-hand one for himself, <em>without any letters</em>, and to have it by him while he reads, and keep his finger on that particular <em>part</em> of it, about which he is reading.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Secondly, let us suppose that we have selected a certain Adjunct, which we may call “<em>m</em>”, and have subdivided the <em>x</em>y_-Class into the two Classes whose Differentiæ are <em>m</em> and <em>m′</em>, and that we have assigned the N.W. <em>Inner</em> Cell to the one (which we may call “the Class of <em>x</em>y_m_-Things”, or “the <em>x</em>y_m_-Class”), and the N.W. <em>Outer</em> Cell to the other (which we may call “the Class of <em>x</em>y_m′_-Things”, or “the <em>x</em>y_m′_-Class”).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Thus, in the “books” example, we might say “Let <em>m</em> mean ‘bound’, so that <em>m′</em> will mean ‘unbound’”, and we might suppose that we had subdivided the Class “old English books” into the two Classes, “old English bound books” and “old English unbound books”, and had assigned the N.W. <em>Inner</em> Cell to the one, and the N.W. <em>Outer</em> Cell to the other.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thirdly, let us suppose that we have subdivided the <em>x</em>y′<em>-Class, the _x′<em>y</em>-Class, and the _x′_y′_-Class in the same manner, and have, in each case, assigned the _Inner</em> Cell to the Class possessing the Attribute <em>m</em>, and the <em>Outer</em> Cell to the Class possessing the Attribute <em>m′</em>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Thus, in the “books” example, we might suppose that we had subdivided the “new English books” into the two Classes, “new English bound books” and “new English unbound books”, and had assigned the S.W. <em>Inner</em> Cell to the one, and the S.W. <em>Outer</em> Cell to the other.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is evident that we have now assigned the <em>Inner Square</em> to the <em>m</em>-Class, and the <em>Outer Border</em> to the _m′_-Class.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Thus, in the “books” example, we have assigned the <em>Inner Square</em> to “bound books” and the <em>Outer Border</em> to “unbound books”.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When the Reader has made himself familiar with this Diagram, he ought to be able to find, in a moment, the Compartment assigned to a particular <em>pair</em> of Attributes, or the Cell assigned to a particular <em>trio</em> of Attributes. The following Rules will help him in doing this:—</p>
<p>  Arrange the Attributes in the order <em>x</em>, <em>y</em>, <em>m</em>.</p>
<p> (2 Take the <em>first</em> of them and find the Compartment assigned to it.</p>
<p>  Then take the <em>second</em>, and find what <em>portion</em> of that compartment is assigned to it.</p>
<p>  Treat the <em>third</em>, if there is one, in the same way.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For example, suppose we have to find the Compartment assigned to <em>y</em>m_. We say to ourselves “<em>y</em> has the <em>West</em> Half; and <em>m</em> has the <em>Inner</em> portion of that West Half.”
Again, suppose we have to find the Cell assigned to <em>x′<em>y</em>m′</em>. We say to ourselves “<em>x′</em> has the <em>South</em> Half; <em>y</em> has the <em>West</em> portion of that South Half, i.e. has the <em>South-West Quarter</em>; and <em>m′</em> has the <em>Outer</em> portion of that South-West Quarter.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Reader should now get his genial friend to question him on the Table given on the next page, in the style of the following specimen-Dialogue.</p>

<h5><em>REPRESENTATION OF PROPOSITIONS IN TERMS OF x AND m, OR OF y AND m.</em></h5>
<h5>§ 1.</h5>
<h6><em>Representation of Propositions of Existence in terms of _x</em> and <em>m</em>, or of <em>y</em> and <em>m</em>._</h6>


<img class="overlay" width="100%" height="100%" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marvindanig/symbolic-logic/master/assets/images/b4c2d01.png" alt="Diagram representing x m exists">
<p>Let us take, first, the Proposition “Some <em>x</em>m_ exist”.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>\ Note that the <em>full</em> meaning of this Proposition is (as explained at [p. 12 “Some existing Things are <em>x</em>m_-Things”.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This tells us that there is at least <em>one</em> Thing in the Inner portion of the North Half; that is, that this Compartment is <em>occupied</em>. And this we can evidently represent by placing a <em>Red</em> Counter on the partition which divides it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the “books” example, this Proposition would mean “Some old bound books exist” (or “There are some old bound books”).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Similarly we may represent the seven similar Propositions, “Some <em>x</em>m′_ exist”, “Some <em>x′_m</em> exist”, “Some <em>x′_m′</em> exist”, “Some <em>y</em>m_ exist”, “Some <em>y</em>m′_ exist”, “Some <em>y′_m</em> exist”, and “Some <em>y′_m′</em> exist”.</p>


<img class="overlay" width="100%" height="100%" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marvindanig/symbolic-logic/master/assets/images/b4c2d02.png" alt="Diagram representing x m does not exist">
<p>Let us take, next, the Proposition “No <em>x</em>m_ exist”.</p>
<p>This tells us that there is <em>nothing</em> in the Inner portion of the North Half; that is, that this Compartment is <em>empty</em>. And this we can represent by placing <em>two Grey</em> Counters in it, one in each Cell.</p>
<p>Similarly we may represent the seven similar Propositions, in terms of <em>x</em> and <em>m</em>, or of <em>y</em> and <em>m</em>, viz. “No <em>x</em>m′_ exist”, “No <em>x′_m</em> exist”, &amp;c.</p>
<p>These sixteen Propositions of Existence are the only ones that we shall have to represent on this Diagram.</p>

<p>Let us take, first, the Pair of Converse Propositions</p>
<p>“Some <em>x</em> are <em>m</em>” = “Some <em>m</em> are <em>x</em>.”</p>
<p>We know that each of these is equivalent to the Proposition of Existence “Some <em>x</em>m_ exist”, which we already know how to represent.</p>

<img class="overlay" width="100%" height="100%" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marvindanig/symbolic-logic/master/assets/images/b4c2d05.png" alt="Diagram representing all x are m">
<p>Let us take, next, the Proposition “All <em>x</em> are <em>m</em>.”</p>
<p>We know (see  p. 18 that this is a <em>Double</em> Proposition, and equivalent to the <em>two</em> Propositions “Some <em>x</em> are <em>m</em>” and “No <em>x</em> are <em>m′</em> ”, each of which we already know how to represent.</p>
<p>Similarly for the fifteen similar Propositions, in terms of <em>x</em> and <em>m</em>, or of <em>y</em> and <em>m</em>.</p>
<p>These thirty-two Propositions of Relation are the only ones that we shall have to represent on this Diagram.</p>
<p>The Reader should now get his genial friend to question him on the following four Tables.</p>
<p>The Victim should have nothing before him but a blank Triliteral Diagram, a Red Counter, and 2 Grey ones, with which he is to represent the various Propositions named by the Inquisitor, <em>e.g.</em> “No <em>y′</em> are <em>m</em>”, “Some <em>x</em>m′_ exist”, &amp;c., &amp;c.</p>

<h4>CHAPTER III.</h4>
<h5><em>REPRESENTATION OF TWO PROPOSITIONS OF RELATION, ONE IN TERMS OF _x</em> AND <em>m</em>, AND THE OTHER IN TERMS OF <em>y</em> AND <em>m</em>, ON THE SAME DIAGRAM._</h5>
<p>The Reader had better now begin to draw little Diagrams for himself, and to mark them with the Digits “I” and “O”, instead of using the Board and Counters: he may put a “I” to represent a <em>Red</em> Counter (this may be interpreted to mean “There is at least <em>one</em> Thing here”), and a “O” to represent a <em>Grey</em> Counter (this may be interpreted to mean “There is <em>nothing</em> here”).</p>
<p>The Pair of Propositions, that we shall have to represent, will always be, one in terms of <em>x</em> and <em>m</em>, and the other in terms of <em>y</em> and <em>m</em>.</p>
<p>When we have to represent a Proposition beginning with “All”, we break it up into the <em>two</em> Propositions to which it is equivalent.</p>
<p>When we have to represent, on the same Diagram, Propositions, of which some begin with “Some” and others with “No”, we represent the <em>negative</em> ones <em>first</em>. This will sometimes save us from having to put a “I” “on a fence” and afterwards having to shift it into a Cell.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Let us work a few examples.
“No <em>x</em> are <em>m′</em>;  
  No <em>y′</em> are <em>m</em>”.
Let us first represent “No <em>x</em> are <em>m′_”. This gives us Diagram _a</em>.
Then, representing “No <em>y′</em> are <em>m</em>” on the same Diagram, we get Diagram <em>b</em>.
<em>a</em></p>
<p><em>b</em>

</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“Some <em>m</em> are <em>x</em>;  
  No <em>m</em> are <em>y</em>”.
If, neglecting the Rule, we were begin with “Some <em>m</em> are <em>x</em>”, we should get Diagram <em>a</em>.
And if we were then to take “No <em>m</em> are <em>y</em>”, which tells us that the Inner N.W. Cell is <em>empty</em>, we should be obliged to take the “I” off the fence (as it no longer has the choice of <em>two</em> Cells), and to put it into the Inner N.E. Cell, as in Diagram <em>c</em>.
This trouble may be saved by beginning with “No <em>m</em> are <em>y</em>”, as in Diagram <em>b</em>.
And <em>now</em>, when we take “Some <em>m</em> are <em>x</em>”, there is no fence to sit on! The “I” has to go, at once, into the N.E. Cell, as in Diagram <em>c</em>.

</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“No <em>x′</em> are <em>m′</em>;  
  All <em>m</em> are <em>y</em>”.
Here we begin by breaking up the Second into the two Propositions to which it is equivalent. Thus we have <em>three</em> Propositions to represent, viz.—
  “No <em>x′</em> are <em>m′</em>;</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>Some _m_ are _y_;

No _m_ are _y′_”.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>These we will take in the order 1, 3, 2.
First we take No. (1), viz. “No <em>x′</em> are <em>m′_”. This gives us Diagram _a</em>.
Adding to this, No. (3), viz. “No <em>m</em> are <em>y′_”, we get Diagram _b</em>.
This time the “I”, representing No. (2), viz. “Some <em>m</em> are <em>y</em>,” has to sit on the fence, as there is no “O” to order it off! This gives us Diagram <em>c</em>.
<em>a</em></p>

</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“All <em>m</em> are <em>x</em>;  
  All <em>y</em> are <em>m</em>”.
Here we break up <em>both</em> Propositions, and thus get <em>four</em> to represent, viz.—
  “Some <em>m</em> are <em>x</em>;</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>No _m_ are _x′_;

Some _y_ are _m_;

No _y_ are _m′_”.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>These we will take in the order 2, 4, 1, 3.
First we take No. (2), viz. “No <em>m</em> are <em>x′_”. This gives us Diagram _a</em>.
To this we add No. (4), viz. “No <em>y</em> are <em>m′_”, and thus get Diagram _b</em>.
If we were to add to this No. (1), viz. “Some <em>m</em> are <em>x</em>”, we should have to put the “I” on a fence: so let us try No. (3 instead, viz. “Some <em>y</em> are <em>m</em>”. This gives us Diagram <em>c</em>.
And now there is no need to trouble about No. (1), as it would not add anything to our information to put a “I” on the fence. The Diagram <em>already</em> tells us that “Some <em>m</em> are <em>x</em>”.

<h4>CHAPTER IV.</h4>
<h5><em>INTERPRETATION, IN TERMS OF _x</em> AND <em>y</em>, OF TRILITERAL DIAGRAM, WHEN MARKED WITH COUNTERS OR DIGITS._</h5>
<p>The problem before us is, given a marked Triliteral Diagram, to ascertain <em>what</em> Propositions of Relation, in terms of <em>x</em> and <em>y</em>, are represented on it.</p>
<p>The best plan, for a <em>beginner</em>, is to draw a <em>Biliteral</em> Diagram alongside of it, and to transfer, from the one to the other, all the information he can. He can then read off, from the Biliteral Diagram, the required Propositions. After a little practice, he will be able to dispense with the Biliteral Diagram, and to read off the result from the Triliteral Diagram itself.</p>
<p>To <em>transfer</em> the information, observe the following Rules:—</p>
<p>  Examine the N.W. Quarter of the Triliteral Diagram.</p>
<p>  If it contains a “I”, in <em>either</em> Cell, it is certainly <em>occupied</em>, and you may mark the N.W. Quarter of the Biliteral Diagram with a “I”.</p>
<p>  If it contains <em>two</em> “O”s, one in <em>each</em> Cell, it is certainly <em>empty</em>, and you may mark the N.W. Quarter of the Biliteral Diagram with a “O”.</p>
<p>  Deal in the same way with the N.E., the S.W., and the S.E. Quarter.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Let us take, as examples, the results of the four Examples worked in the previous Chapters.
<img class="overlay" width="100%" height="100%" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marvindanig/symbolic-logic/master/assets/images/b4c4d01.png" alt="Diagram representing example 1">
In the N.W. Quarter, only <em>one</em> of the two Cells is marked as <em>empty</em>: so we do not know whether the N.W. Quarter of the Biliteral Diagram is <em>occupied</em> or <em>empty</em>: so we cannot mark it.
<img class="overlay" width="100%" height="100%" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marvindanig/symbolic-logic/master/assets/images/b4c4d02.png" alt="Diagram representing conclusion of example 1">
In the N.E. Quarter, we find <em>two</em> “O”s: so <em>this</em> Quarter is certainly <em>empty</em>; and we mark it so on the Biliteral Diagram.
In the S.W. Quarter, we have no information <em>at all</em>.
In the S.E. Quarter, we have not enough to use.
We may read off the result as “No <em>x</em> are <em>y′_”, or “No _y′</em> are <em>x</em>,” whichever we prefer.

In the S.E. Quarter, we have none at all.
We may read off the result as “Some <em>x</em> are <em>y′_”, or “Some _y′</em> are <em>x</em>”, whichever we prefer.

Neither have we in the S.W. Quarter.

The N.W. Quarter is _occupied</em>, in spite of the “O” in the Outer Cell. So we mark it with a “I” on the Biliteral Diagram.
The N.E. Quarter yields no information.

<h4>SYLLOGISMS.</h4>
<hr>
<h4>CHAPTER I.</h4>
<h5><em>INTRODUCTORY</em></h5>
<p>When a Trio of Biliteral Propositions of Relation is such that all their six Terms are Species of the same Genus, every two of them contain between them a Pair of codivisional Classes, the three Propositions are so related that, if the first two were true, the third would be true, the Trio is called a ‘Syllogism’; the Genus, of which each of the six Terms is a Species, is called its ‘Universe of Discourse’, or, more briefly, its ‘Univ.’; the first two Propositions are called its ‘Premisses’, and the third its ‘Conclusion’; also the Pair of codivisional Terms in the Premisses are called its ‘Eliminands’, and the other two its ‘Retinends’.</p>
<p>The Conclusion of a Syllogism is said to be ‘consequent’ from its Premisses: hence it is usual to prefix to it the word “Therefore” (or the Symbol “∴”).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note that the ‘Eliminands’ are so called because they are <em>eliminated</em>, and do not appear in the Conclusion; and that the ‘Retinends’ are so called because they are <em>retained</em>, and <em>do</em> appear in the Conclusion.
Note also that the question, whether the Conclusion is or is not <em>consequent</em> from the Premisses, is not affected by the <em>actual</em> truth or falsity of any of the Trio, but depends entirely on their <em>relationship to each other</em>.
As a specimen-Syllogism, let us take the Trio
“No <em>x</em>-Things are <em>m</em>-Things;<br>  No <em>y</em>-Things are <em>m′_-Things.<br>          No <em>x</em>-Things are <em>y</em>-Things.”
which we may write, as explained at , thus:—
“No _x</em> are <em>m</em>;  
  No <em>y</em> are <em>m′</em>.  
          No <em>x</em> are <em>y</em>”.
Here the first and second contain the Pair of codivisional Classes <em>m</em> and <em>m′</em>; the first and third contain the Pair <em>x</em> and <em>x</em>; and the second and third contain the Pair <em>y</em> and <em>y</em>.
Also the three Propositions are (as we shall see hereafter so related that, if the first two were true, the third would also be true.
Hence the Trio is a <em>Syllogism</em>; the two Propositions, “No <em>x</em> are <em>m</em>” and “No <em>y</em> are <em>m′_”, are its _Premisses</em>; the Proposition “No <em>x</em> are <em>y</em>” is its <em>Conclusion</em>; the Terms <em>m</em> and <em>m′</em> are its <em>Eliminands</em>; and the Terms <em>x</em> and <em>y</em> are its <em>Retinends</em>.
Hence we may write it thus:—
“No <em>x</em> are <em>m</em>;  
  No <em>y</em> are <em>m′</em>.  
  ∴ No <em>x</em> are <em>y</em>”.
As a second specimen, let us take the Trio
“All cats understand French;<br>  Some chickens are cats.<br>          Some chickens understand French”.
These, put into normal form, are
“All cats are creatures understanding French;<br>  Some chickens are cats.<br>          Some chickens are creatures understanding French”.
Here all the six Terms are Species of the Genus “creatures.”
Also the first and second Propositions contain the Pair of codivisional Classes “cats” and “cats”; the first and third contain the Pair “creatures understanding French” and “creatures understanding French”; and the second and third contain the Pair “chickens” and “chickens”.
Also the three Propositions are (as we shall see at  p. 64 so related that, if the first two were true, the third would be true. (The first two are, as it happens, <em>not</em> strictly true in <em>our</em> planet. But there is nothing to hinder them from being true in some <em>other</em> planet, say <em>Mars</em> or <em>Jupiter_—in which case the third would _also</em> be true in that planet, and its inhabitants would probably engage chickens as nursery-governesses. They would thus secure a singular <em>contingent</em> privilege, unknown in England, namely, that they would be able, at any time when provisions ran short, to utilise the nursery-governess for the nursery-dinner!
Hence the Trio is a <em>Syllogism</em>; the Genus “creatures” is its ‘Univ.’; the two Propositions, “All cats understand French“ and ”Some chickens are cats”, are its <em>Premisses</em>, the Proposition “Some chickens understand French” is its <em>Conclusion</em>; the Terms “cats” and “cats” are its <em>Eliminands</em>; and the Terms, “creatures understanding French” and “chickens”, are its <em>Retinends</em>.
Hence we may write it thus:—
“All cats understand French;<br>  Some chickens are cats;<br>  ∴ Some chickens understand French”.</p>

<h4>CHAPTER II.</h4>
<h5><em>PROBLEMS IN SYLLOGISMS.</em></h5>
<h5>§ 1.</h5>
<h6><em>Introductory.</em></h6>
<p>When the Terms of a Proposition are represented by <em>words</em>, it is said to be ‘concrete’; when by <em>letters</em>, ‘abstract.’</p>
<p>To translate a Proposition from concrete into abstract form, we fix on a Univ., and regard each Term as a <em>Species</em> of it, and we choose a letter to represent its <em>Differentia</em>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>\ For example, suppose we wish to translate “Some soldiers are brave” into abstract form. We may take “men” as Univ., and regard “soldiers” and “brave men” as <em>Species</em> of the <em>Genus</em> “men”; and we may choose <em>x</em> to represent the peculiar Attribute (say “military” of “soldiers,” and <em>y</em> to represent “brave.” Then the Proposition may be written “Some military men are brave men”; <em>i.e.</em> “Some <em>x</em>-men are <em>y</em>-men”; <em>i.e.</em> (omitting “men,” as explained at [p. 26 “Some <em>x</em> are <em>y</em>.”
In practice, we should merely say “Let Univ. be “men”, <em>x</em> = soldiers, <em>y</em> = brave”, and at once translate “Some soldiers are brave” into “Some <em>x</em> are <em>y</em>.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Problems we shall have to solve are of two kinds, viz.</p>
<p>  “Given a Pair of Propositions of Relation, which contain between them a pair of codivisional Classes, and which are proposed as Premisses: to ascertain what Conclusion, if any, is consequent from them.”</p>
<p>  “Given a Trio of Propositions of Relation, of which every two contain a pair of codivisional Classes, and which are proposed as a Syllogism: to ascertain whether the proposed Conclusion is consequent from the proposed Premisses, and, if so, whether it is <em>complete</em>.”</p>
<p>These Problems we will discuss separately.</p>
<h5>§ 2.</h5>
<h6><em>Given a Pair of Propositions of Relation, which contain between them a pair of codivisional Classes, and which are proposed as Premisses: to ascertain what Conclusion, if any, is consequent from them.</em></h6>
<p>The Rules, for doing this, are as follows:—</p>
<p>  Determine the ‘Universe of Discourse’.</p>
<p>  Construct a Dictionary, making <em>m</em> and <em>m</em> (or <em>m</em> and <em>m′</em> represent the pair of codivisional Classes, and <em>x</em> (or <em>x′</em> and <em>y</em> (or <em>y′</em> the other two.</p>
<p>  Translate the proposed Premisses into abstract form.</p>
<p>  Represent them, together, on a Triliteral Diagram.</p>
<p>  Ascertain what Proposition, if any, in terms of <em>x</em> and <em>y</em>, is <em>also</em> represented on it.</p>
<p>  Translate this into concrete form.</p>
<p>It is evident that, if the proposed Premisses were true, this other Proposition would <em>also</em> be true. Hence it is a <em>Conclusion</em> consequent from the proposed Premisses.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Let us work some examples.
“No son of mine is dishonest;<br>  People always treat an honest man with respect”.
Taking “men” as Univ., we may write these as follows:—
“No sons of mine are dishonest men;<br>  All honest men are men treated with respect”.
We can now construct our Dictionary, viz. <em>m</em> = honest; <em>x</em> = sons of mine; <em>y</em> = treated with respect.
(Note that the expression “<em>x</em> = sons of mine” is an abbreviated form of “<em>x</em> = the Differentia of ‘sons of mine’, when regarded as a Species of ‘men’”.)
The next thing is to translate the proposed Premisses into abstract form, as follows:—
“No <em>x</em> are <em>m′</em>;  
  All <em>m</em> are <em>y</em>”.
<img class="overlay" width="100%" height="100%" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marvindanig/symbolic-logic/master/assets/images/b5c2d01.png" alt="Diagram representing x m prime does not exist and all m are y">
Next, by the process described at , we represent these on a Triliteral Diagram, thus:—
<img class="overlay" width="100%" height="100%" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marvindanig/symbolic-logic/master/assets/images/b5c2d02.png" alt="Diagram representing x y prime does not exist">
Next, by the process described at , we transfer to a Biliteral Diagram all the information we can.
The result we read as “No <em>x</em> are <em>y′_” or as “No _y′</em> are <em>x</em>,” whichever we prefer. So we refer to our Dictionary, to see which will look best; and we choose
“No <em>x</em> are <em>y′_”,
which, translated into concrete form, is
“No son of mine fails to be treated with respect”.
“All cats understand French;<br>  Some chickens are cats”.
Taking “creatures” as Univ., we write these as follows:—
“All cats are creatures understanding French;<br>  Some chickens are cats”.
We can now construct our Dictionary, viz. _m</em> = cats; <em>x</em> = understanding French; <em>y</em> = chickens.
The proposed Premisses, translated into abstract form, are
“All <em>m</em> are <em>x</em>;  
  Some <em>y</em> are <em>m</em>”.
In order to represent these on a Triliteral Diagram, we break up the first into the two Propositions to which it is equivalent, and thus get the <em>three</em> Propositions
  “Some <em>m</em> are <em>x</em>;</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>No _m_ are _x′_;

Some _y_ are _m_”.</code></pre>


<img class="overlay" width="100%" height="100%" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marvindanig/symbolic-logic/master/assets/images/b5c2d03.png" alt="Diagram representing x m and y m exist and x prime m does not exist">
<blockquote>
<p>The Rule, given at , would make us take these in the order 2, 1, 3.
This, however, would produce the result
<img class="overlay" width="100%" height="100%" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marvindanig/symbolic-logic/master/assets/images/b5c2d04.png" alt="Alternative diagram representing x m and y m exist and x prime m does not exist">
So it would be better to take them in the order 2, 3, 1. Nos. (2 and (3 give us the result here shown; and now we need not trouble about No. (1), as the Proposition “Some <em>m</em> are <em>x</em>” is <em>already</em> represented on the Diagram.
<img class="overlay" width="100%" height="100%" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marvindanig/symbolic-logic/master/assets/images/b5c2d05.png" alt="Diagram representing x y exists">
Transferring our information to a Biliteral Diagram, we get
This result we can read either as “Some <em>x</em> are <em>y</em>” or “Some <em>y</em> are <em>x</em>”.
After consulting our Dictionary, we choose
“Some <em>y</em> are <em>x</em>”,
which, translated into concrete form, is
“Some chickens understand French.”
“All diligent students are successful;<br>  All ignorant students are unsuccessful”.
Let Univ. be “students”; <em>m</em> = successful; <em>x</em> = diligent; <em>y</em> = ignorant.
These Premisses, in abstract form, are
“All <em>x</em> are <em>m</em>;  
  All <em>y</em> are <em>m′_”.
These, broken up, give us the four Propositions
  “Some _x</em> are <em>m</em>;</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>No _x_ are _m′_;

Some _y_ are _m′_;

<p>Here is <em>another</em> opportunity, gentle Reader, for playing a trick on your innocent friend. Put the proposed Syllogism before him, and ask him what he thinks of the Conclusion.

If <em>I</em> were one of them, and knew the <em>Premisses</em> to be true, I should be <em>quite</em> clear that I <em>needn’t</em> run—and I <em>should walk!_”

You may then explain to him, as a convenient <em>test</em> of the soundness of a Syllogism, that, if circumstances can be invented which, without interfering with the truth of the <em>Premisses</em>, would make the <em>Conclusion</em> false, the Syllogism <em>must</em> be unsound.</p>

<h4>BOOK VI.</h4>
<h3>THE METHOD OF SUBSCRIPTS.</h3>
<hr>
<h4>CHAPTER I.</h4>
<h5><em>INTRODUCTORY.</em></h5>
<p>Let us agree that “<em>x</em>1” shall mean “Some existing Things have the Attribute <em>x</em>”, i.e. (more briefly “Some <em>x</em> exist”; also that “<em>x</em>y_1” shall mean “Some <em>x</em>y_ exist”, and so on. Such a Proposition may be called an ‘Entity.’</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note that, when there are <em>two</em> letters in the expression, it does not in the least matter which stands <em>first</em>: “<em>x</em>y_1” and “<em>y</em>x_1” mean exactly the same.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Also that “<em>x</em>0” shall mean “No existing Things have the Attribute <em>x</em>”, i.e. (more briefly “No <em>x</em> exist”; also that “<em>x</em>y_0” shall mean “No <em>x</em>y_ exist”, and so on. Such a Proposition may be called a ‘Nullity’.</p>
<p>Also that “†” shall mean “and”.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Thus “<em>a</em>b_1 † <em>c</em>d_0” means “Some <em>a</em>b_ exist and no <em>c</em>d_ exist”.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Also that “¶” shall mean “would, if true, prove”.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Thus, “<em>x</em>0 ¶ <em>x</em>y_0” means “The Proposition ‘No <em>x</em> exist’ would, if true, prove the Proposition ‘No <em>x</em>y_ exist’”.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When two Letters are both of them accented, or both <em>not</em> accented, they are said to have ‘Like Signs’, or to be ‘Like’: when one is accented, and the other not, they are said to have ‘Unlike Signs’, or to be ‘Unlike’.</p>
<hr>
<h4>CHAPTER II.</h4>
<h5><em>REPRESENTATION OF PROPOSITIONS OF RELATION.</em></h5>
<p>Let us take, first, the Proposition “Some <em>x</em> are <em>y</em>”.</p>
<p>This, we know, is equivalent to the Proposition of Existence “Some <em>x</em>y_ exist”. (See  p. 31 </p>
<p>The Converse Proposition “Some <em>y</em> are <em>x</em>” may of course be represented by the <em>same</em> expression, viz. “<em>x</em>y_1”.</p>
<p>Similarly we may represent the three similar Pairs of Converse Propositions, viz.—</p>
<p>“Some <em>x</em> are <em>y′_”  = “Some _y′</em> are <em>x</em>”,<br>“Some <em>x′</em> are <em>y</em>”  = “Some <em>y</em> are <em>x′_”,<br>“Some _x′</em> are <em>y′_” = “Some _y′</em> are _x′_”.</p>
<p>Let us take, next, the Proposition “No <em>x</em> are <em>y</em>”.</p>
<p>This, we know, is equivalent to the Proposition of Existence “No <em>x</em>y_ exist”. (See  p. 33 </p>
<p>The Converse Proposition “No <em>y</em> are <em>x</em>” may of course be represented by the <em>same</em> expression, viz. “<em>x</em>y_0”.</p>
<p>Similarly we may represent the three similar Pairs of Converse Propositions, viz.—</p>
<p>“No <em>x</em> are <em>y′_”  = “No _y′</em> are <em>x</em>”,<br>“No <em>x′</em> are <em>y</em>”  = “No <em>y</em> are <em>x′_”,<br>“No _x′</em> are <em>y′_” = “No _y′</em> are _x′_”.</p>
<p>Let us take, next, the Proposition “All <em>x</em> are <em>y</em>”.</p>
<p>Now it is evident that the Double Proposition of Existence “Some <em>x</em> exist and no <em>x</em>y′_ exist” tells us that <em>some</em> <em>x</em>-Things exist, but that <em>none</em> of them have the Attribute <em>y′</em>: that is, it tells us that <em>all</em> of them have the Attribute <em>y</em>: that is, it tells us that “All <em>x</em> are <em>y</em>”.</p>
<p>Also it is evident that the expression “<em>x</em>1 † <em>x</em>y′_0” represents this Double Proposition.</p>
<p>Hence it also represents the Proposition “All <em>x</em> are <em>y</em>”.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>, to be equivalent to the Double Proposition “Some <em>x</em> are <em>y</em> and no <em>x</em> are <em>y′_” (i.e. “Some <em>x</em>y</em> exist and no <em>x</em>y′_ exist”). The explanation is that the Proposition “Some <em>x</em>y_ exist” contains <em>superfluous information</em>. “Some <em>x</em> exist” is enough for our purpose.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This expression may be written in a shorter form, viz. “<em>x</em>1_y′<em>0”, since _each</em> Subscript takes effect back to the <em>beginning</em> of the expression.</p>
<p>Similarly we may represent the seven similar Propositions “All <em>x</em> are <em>y′_”, “All _x′</em> are <em>y</em>”, “All <em>x′</em> are <em>y′_”, “All _y</em> are <em>x</em>”, “All <em>y</em> are <em>x′_”, “All _y′</em> are <em>x</em>”, and “All <em>y′</em> are _x′_”.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Reader should make out all these for himself.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It will be convenient to remember that, in translating a Proposition, beginning with “All”, from abstract form into subscript form, or <em>vice versâ</em>, the Predicate <em>changes sign</em> (that is, changes from positive to negative, or else from negative to positive).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Thus, the Proposition “All <em>y</em> are <em>x′_” becomes “<em>y</em>1_x_0”, where the Predicate changes from _x′</em> to <em>x</em>.
Again, the expression “<em>x′<em>1</em>y′_0” becomes “All _x′</em> are <em>y</em>”, where the Predicate changes for <em>y′</em> to <em>y</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<h4>CHAPTER III.</h4>
<h5><em>SYLLOGISMS.</em></h5>
<h5>§ 1.</h5>
<h6><em>Representation of Syllogisms.</em></h6>
<p>We already know how to represent each of the three Propositions of a Syllogism in subscript form. When that is done, all we need, besides, is to write the three expressions in a row, with “†” between the Premisses, and “¶” before the Conclusion.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Thus the Syllogism
“No <em>x</em> are <em>m′</em>;  
  All <em>m</em> are <em>y</em>.  
        ∴ No <em>x</em> are <em>y′</em>.”
may be represented thus:—
<em>x</em>m′<em>0 † <em>m</em>1_y′_0 ¶ <em>x</em>y′_0
When a Proposition has to be translated from concrete form into subscript form, the Reader will find it convenient, just at first, to translate it into _abstract</em> form, and <em>thence</em> into subscript form. But, after a little practice, he will find it quite easy to go straight from concrete form to subscript form.</p>
</blockquote>
<h5>§ 2.</h5>
<h6><em>Formulæ for solving Problems in Syllogisms.</em></h6>
<p>When once we have found, by Diagrams, the Conclusion to a given Pair of Premisses, and have represented the Syllogism in subscript form, we have a <em>Formula</em>, by which we can at once find, without having to use Diagrams again, the Conclusion to any <em>other</em> Pair of Premisses having the <em>same</em> subscript forms.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Thus, the expression
is a Formula, by which we can find the Conclusion to any Pair of Premisses whose subscript forms are
For example, suppose we had the Pair of Propositions
“No gluttons are healthy;<br>  No unhealthy men are strong”.
proposed as Premisses. Taking “men” as our ‘Universe’, and making <em>m</em> = healthy; <em>x</em> = gluttons; <em>y</em> = strong; we might translate the Pair into abstract form, thus:—</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“No <em>x</em> are <em>m</em>;  
No <em>m′</em> are <em>y</em>”.
These, in subscript form, would be
which are identical with those in our <em>Formula</em>. Hence we at once know the Conclusion to be
that is, in abstract form,
that is, in concrete form,
“No gluttons are strong”.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I shall now take three different forms of Pairs of Premisses, and work out their Conclusions, once for all, by Diagrams; and thus obtain some useful Formulæ. I shall call them “Fig. I”, “Fig. II”, and “Fig. III”.</p>
<h6>Fig. I.</h6>
<p>This includes any Pair of Premisses which are both of them Nullities, and which contain Unlike Eliminands.</p>
<p>The simplest case is</p>

<p>In this case we see that the Conclusion is a Nullity, and that the Retinends have kept their Signs.</p>
<p>And we should find this Rule to hold good with <em>any</em> Pair of Premisses which fulfil the given conditions.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Reader had better satisfy himself of this, by working out, on Diagrams, several varieties, such as</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If either Retinend is asserted in the <em>Premisses</em> to exist, of course it may be so asserted in the <em>Conclusion</em>.</p>
<p>Hence we get two <em>Variants</em> of Fig. I, viz.</p>
<p>α where <em>one</em> Retinend is so asserted;</p>
<p>β where <em>both</em> are so asserted.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Reader had better work out, on Diagrams, examples of these two Variants, such as</p>

<p>The Formula, to be remembered, is with the following two Rules:—</p>
<p>  <em>Two Nullities, with Unlike Eliminands, yield a Nullity, in which both Retinends keep their Signs.</em></p>
<p>  <em>A Retinend, asserted in the Premisses to exist, may be so asserted in the Conclusion.</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note that Rule (1 is merely the Formula expressed in words.</p>
</blockquote>
<h6>Fig. II.</h6>
<p>This includes any Pair of Premisses, of which one is a Nullity and the other an Entity, and which contain Like Eliminands.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The Formula, to be remembered, is,</p>
<p><em>x</em>m_0 † <em>y</em>m_1 ¶ _x′<em>y</em>1</p>
<p>with the following Rule:—</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Note that “<em>m</em>1” is here stated <em>separately</em>, because it does not matter in which of the two Premisses it occurs: so that this includes the <em>three</em> forms “<em>m</em>1_x_0 † <em>y</em>m_0”, “<em>x</em>m_0 † <em>m</em>1_y_0”, and “<em>m</em>1_x_0 † <em>m</em>1_y_0”.

<h5>§ 3.</h5>
<h6><em>Fallacies.</em></h6>
<p>Any argument which <em>deceives</em> us, by seeming to prove what it does not really prove, may be called a ‘Fallacy’ (derived from the Latin verb <em>fallo</em> “I deceive”): but the particular kind, to be now discussed, consists of a Pair of Propositions, which are proposed as the Premisses of a Syllogism, but yield no Conclusion.</p>
<p>When each of the proposed Premisses is a Proposition in <em>I</em>, or <em>E</em>, or <em>A</em>, (the only kinds with which we are now concerned, the Fallacy may be detected by the ‘Method of Diagrams,’ by simply setting them out on a Triliteral Diagram, and observing that they yield no information which can be transferred to the Biliteral Diagram.</p>
<p>But suppose we were working by the ‘Method of <em>Subscripts</em>,’ and had to deal with a Pair of proposed Premisses, which happened to be a ‘Fallacy,’ how could we be certain that they would not yield any Conclusion?</p>
<p>Our best plan is, I think, to deal with <em>Fallacies</em> in the same was as we have already dealt with <em>Syllogisms</em>: that is, to take certain forms of Pairs of Propositions, and to work  them out, once for all, on the Triliteral Diagram, and ascertain that they yield <em>no</em> Conclusion; and then to record them, for future use, as <em>Formulæ for Fallacies</em>, just as we have already recorded our three <em>Formulæ for Syllogisms</em>.</p>
<p>Now, if we were to record the two Sets of Formulæ in the <em>same</em> shape, viz. by the Method of Subscripts, there would be considerable risk of confusing the two kinds. Hence, in order to keep them distinct, I propose to record the Formulæ for <em>Fallacies</em> in <em>words</em>, and to call them “Forms” instead of “Formulæ.”</p>
<p>Let us now proceed to find, by the Method of Diagrams, three “Forms of Fallacies,” which we will then put on record for future use. They are as follows:—</p>
<p>  Fallacy of Like Eliminands not asserted to exist.</p>
<p>  Fallacy of Unlike Eliminands with an Entity-Premiss.</p>
<p>  Fallacy of two Entity-Premisses.</p>
<p>These shall be discussed separately, and it will be seen that each fails to yield a Conclusion.</p>
<h6>(1 <em>Fallacy of Like Eliminands not asserted to exist.</em></h6>
<p>It is evident that neither of the given Propositions can be an <em>Entity</em>, since that kind asserts the <em>existence</em> of both of its Terms (see

<h5>§ 4.</h5>
<h6><em>Method of proceeding with a given Pair of Propositions.</em></h6>
<p>Let us suppose that we have before us a Pair of Propositions of Relation, which contain between them a Pair of codivisional Classes, and that we wish to ascertain what Conclusion, if any, is consequent from them. We translate them, if necessary, into subscript-form, and then proceed as follows:—</p>
<p>  We examine their Subscripts, in order to see whether they are</p>
<p>a a Pair of Nullities;</p>
<p>or (b a Nullity and an Entity;</p>
<p>or (c a Pair of Entities.</p>
<p>  If they are a Pair of Nullities, we examine their Eliminands, in order to see whether they are Unlike or Like.</p>
<p>If their Eliminands are <em>Unlike</em>, it is a case of Fig. I. We then examine their Retinends, to see whether one or both of them are asserted to <em>exist</em>. If one Retinend is so asserted, it is a case of Fig. I (α); if both, it is a case of Fig. I (β).</p>
<p>If their Eliminands are Like, we examine them, in order to see whether either of them is asserted to exist. If so, it is a case of Fig. III.; if not, it is a case of “Fallacy of Like Eliminands not asserted to exist.”</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If they are a Nullity and an Entity, we examine their Eliminands, in order to see whether they are Like or Unlike.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If their Eliminands are Like, it is a case of Fig. II.; if <em>Unlike</em>, it is a case of “Fallacy of Unlike Eliminands with an Entity-Premiss.”</p>

<h3>SORITESES.</h3>

<h4>CHAPTER I.</h4>
<h5><em>INTRODUCTORY.</em></h5>
<p>When a Set of three or more Biliteral Propositions are such that all their Terms are Species of the same Genus, and are also so related that two of them, taken together, yield a Conclusion, which, taken with another of them, yields another Conclusion, and so on, until all have been taken, it is evident that, if the original Set were true, the last Conclusion would <em>also</em> be true.</p>
<p>Such a Set, with the last Conclusion tacked on, is called a ‘Sorites’; the original Set of Propositions is called its ‘Premisses’; each of the intermediate Conclusions is called a ‘Partial Conclusion’ of the Sorites; the last Conclusion is called its ‘Complete Conclusion,’ or, more briefly, its ‘Conclusion’; the Genus, of which all the Terms are Species, is called its ‘Universe of Discourse’, or, more briefly, its ‘Univ.’; the Terms, used as Eliminands in the Syllogisms, are called its ‘Eliminands’; and the two Terms, which are retained, and therefore appear in the Conclusion, are called its ‘Retinends’.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note that each <em>Partial</em> Conclusion contains one or two <em>Eliminands</em>; but that the <em>Complete</em> Conclusion contains <em>Retinends</em> only.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Conclusion is said to be ‘consequent’ from the Premisses; for which reason it is usual to prefix to it the word “Therefore” (or the symbol “∴”).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note that the question, whether the Conclusion is or is not <em>consequent</em> from the Premisses, is not affected by the <em>actual</em> truth or falsity of any one of the Propositions which make up the Sorites, by depends entirely on their <em>relationship to one another</em>.
As a specimen-Sorites, let us take the following Set of 5 Propositions:—
  ”No <em>a</em> are <em>b′</em>;</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>All _b_ are _c_;

All _c_ are _d_;

No _e′_ are _a′_;

All _h_ are _e′_”.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>Here the first and second, taken together, yield “No <em>a</em> are <em>c′_”.
This, taken along with the third, yields “No _a</em> are <em>d′_”.
This, taken along with the fourth, yields “No _d′</em> are <em>e′_”.
And this, taken along with the fifth, yields “All _h</em> are <em>d</em>”.
Hence, if the original Set were true, this would <em>also</em> be true.
Hence the original Set, with this tacked on, is a <em>Sorites</em>; the original Set is its <em>Premisses</em>; the Proposition “All <em>h</em> are <em>d</em>” is its <em>Conclusion</em>; the Terms <em>a</em>, <em>b</em>, <em>c</em>, <em>e</em> are its <em>Eliminands</em>; and the Terms <em>d</em> and <em>h</em> are its <em>Retinends</em>.
Hence we may write the whole Sorites thus:—
”No <em>a</em> are <em>b′</em>;  
  All <em>b</em> are <em>c</em>;  
  All <em>c</em> are <em>d</em>;  
  No <em>e′</em> are <em>a′</em>;  
  All <em>h</em> are <em>e′</em>.  
          ∴ All <em>h</em> are <em>d</em>”.
In the above Sorites, the 3 Partial Conclusions are the Positions “No <em>a</em> are <em>e′_”, “No _a</em> are <em>d′_”, “No _d′</em> are <em>e′_”; but, if the Premisses were arranged in other ways, other Partial Conclusions might be obtained. Thus, the order 41523 yields the Partial Conclusions “No _c′</em> are <em>b′_”, “All _h</em> are <em>b</em>”, “All <em>h</em> are <em>c</em>”. There are altogether <em>nine</em> Partial Conclusions to this Sorites, which the Reader will find it an interesting task to make out for himself.</p>

<h5><em>PROBLEMS IN SORITESES.</em></h5>
<h5>§ 1.</h5>
<h6><em>Introductory.</em></h6>
<p>The Problems we shall have to solve are of the following form:—</p>
<p>“Given three or more Propositions of Relation, which are proposed as Premisses: to ascertain what Conclusion, if any, is consequent from them.”</p>
<p>We will limit ourselves, at present, to Problems which can be worked by the Formulæ of Fig. I. (See  p. 75 </p>
<p>Such Problems may be solved by either of two Methods, viz.</p>
<p>  The Method of Separate Syllogisms;</p>
<p>  The Method of Underscoring.</p>
<p>These shall be discussed separately.</p>
<h5>§ 2.</h5>
<h6><em>Solution by Method of Separate Syllogisms.</em></h6>
<p>The Rules, for doing this, are as follows:—</p>
<p>  Name the ‘Universe of Discourse’.</p>
<p>  Construct a Dictionary, making <em>a</em>, <em>b</em>, <em>c</em>, &amp;c. represent the Terms.</p>
<p>  Put the Proposed Premisses into subscript form.</p>
<p>  Select two which, containing between them a pair of codivisional Classes, can be used as the Premisses of a Syllogism.</p>
<p>  Find their Conclusion by Formula.</p>
<p>  Find a third Premiss which, along with this Conclusion, can be used as the Premisses of a second Syllogism.</p>
<p>  Find a second Conclusion by Formula.</p>
<p>  Proceed thus, until all the proposed Premisses have been used.</p>
<p>  Put the last Conclusion, which is the Complete Conclusion of the Sorites, into concrete form.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As an example of this process, let us take, as the proposed Set of Premisses,
  “All the policemen on this beat sup with our cook;</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>No man with long hair can fail to be a poet;

Amos Judd has never been in prison;

Our cook’s ‘cousins’ all love cold mutton;

None but policemen on this beat are poets;

None but her ‘cousins’ ever sup with our cook;

Men with short hair have all been in prison.”</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>Univ. “men”; <em>a</em> = Amos Judd; <em>b</em> = cousins of our cook; <em>c</em> = having been in prison; <em>d</em> = long-haired; <em>e</em> = loving cold mutton; <em>h</em> = poets; <em>k</em> = policemen on this beat; <em>l</em> = supping with our cook
We now have to put the proposed Premisses into <em>subscript</em> form. Let us begin by putting them into <em>abstract</em> form. The result is
  (1 ”All <em>k</em> are <em>l</em>;
  (2   No <em>d</em> are <em>h′</em>;
  (3   All <em>a</em> are <em>c′</em>;
  (4   All <em>b</em> are <em>e</em>;
  (5   No <em>k′</em> are <em>h</em>;
  (6   No <em>b′</em> are <em>l</em>;
  (7   All <em>d′</em> are <em>c</em>.”
And it is now easy to put them into <em>subscript</em> form, as follows:—
  (1 <em>k</em>1_l′<em>0
  (2 <em>d</em>h′_0
  (3 <em>a</em>1_c_0
  (4 <em>b</em>1_e′_0
  (5 _k′<em>h</em>0
  (6 _b′<em>l</em>0
  (7 _d′<em>1</em>c′_0
We now have to find a pair of Premisses which will yield a Conclusion. Let us begin with No. (1), and look down the list, till we come to one which we can take along with it, so as to form Premisses belonging to Fig. I. We find that No. (5 will do, since we can take _k</em> as our Eliminand. So our first syllogism is
  (1 <em>k</em>1_l′<em>0
  (5 _k′<em>h</em>0
∴ _l′<em>h</em>0 … (8)
We must now begin again with _l′<em>h</em>0 and find a Premiss to go along with it. We find that No. (2 will do, _h</em> being our Eliminand. So our next Syllogism is
  (8 _l′<em>h</em>0
  (2 <em>d</em>h′_0
∴ _l′<em>d</em>0 … (9)
We have now used up Nos. (1), (5), and (2), and must search among the others for a partner for _l′<em>d</em>0. We find that No. (6 will do. So we write
  (9 _l′<em>d</em>0
  (6 _b′<em>l</em>0
∴ <em>d</em>b′_0 … (10)
Now what can we take along with <em>d</em>b′_0? No. (4 will do.
  <em>d</em>b′_0</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>  (4 <em>b</em>1_e′_0
∴ <em>d</em>e′_0 … (11)
Along with this we may take No. (7).
  <em>d</em>e′_0</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>  (7 _d′<em>1</em>c′_0
∴ _c′_e′_0 … (12)
And along with this we may take No. (3).
  _c′_e′_0</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>  (3 <em>a</em>1_c_0
∴ <em>a</em>1_e′<em>0
This Complete Conclusion, translated into _abstract</em> form, is
“All <em>a</em> are <em>e</em>”;
and this, translated into <em>concrete</em> form, is
“Amos Judd loves cold mutton.”
In actually <em>working</em> this Problem, the above explanations would, of course, be omitted, and all, that would appear on paper, would be as follows:—
  (1 <em>k</em>1_l′_0
  (2 <em>d</em>h′_0
  (3 <em>a</em>1_c_0
  (4 <em>b</em>1_e′_0
  (5 _k′<em>h</em>0
  (6 _b′<em>l</em>0
  (7 _d′<em>1</em>c′_0
  (1 <em>k</em>1_l′_0
  (5 _k′<em>h</em>0
∴ _l′<em>h</em>0 … (8)
  (8 _l′<em>h</em>0
  (2 <em>d</em>h′_0
∴ _l′<em>d</em>0 … (9)
  (9 _l′<em>d</em>0
  (6 _b′<em>l</em>0
∴ <em>d</em>b′_0 … (10)
  <em>d</em>b′_0</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>  (4 <em>b</em>1_e′_0
∴ <em>d</em>e′_0 … (11)
  <em>d</em>e′_0</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>  (7 _d′<em>1</em>c′_0
∴ _c′_e′_0 … (12)
  _c′_e′_0</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>  (3 <em>a</em>1_c_0
∴ <em>a</em>1_e′<em>0
Note that, in working a Sorites by this Process, we may begin with _any</em> Premiss we choose.</p>
</blockquote>
<h5>§ 3.</h5>
<h6><em>Solution by Method of Underscoring.</em></h6>
<p>Consider the Pair of Premisses</p>
<p><em>x</em>m_0 † <em>y</em>m′_0</p>
<p>which yield the Conclusion <em>x</em>y_0</p>
<p>We see that, in order to get this Conclusion, we must eliminate <em>m</em> and <em>m′</em>, and write <em>x</em> and <em>y</em> together in one expression.</p>
<p>Now, if we agree to <em>mark</em> <em>m</em> and <em>m′</em> as eliminated, and to read the two expressions together, as if they were written in one, the two Premisses will then exactly represent the <em>Conclusion</em>, and we need not write it out separately.</p>
<p>Let us agree to mark the eliminated letters by <em>underscoring</em> them, putting a <em>single</em> score under the <em>first</em>, and a <em>double</em> one under the <em>second</em>.</p>
<p>The two Premisses now become</p>
<p><em>x</em>m_0 † <em>y</em>m_′0</p>
<p>which we read as “<em>x</em>y_0_”.</p>
<p>In copying out the Premisses for underscoring, it will be convenient to <em>omit all subscripts</em>. As to the “0’s” we may always <em>suppose</em> them written, and, as to the “1’s”, we are not concerned to know <em>which</em> Terms are asserted to <em>exist</em>, except those which appear in the <em>Complete</em> Conclusion; and for <em>them</em> it will be easy enough to refer to the original list.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><br>The Data are
1_k_1_l′<em>0 † 2_d_h′_0 † 3_a_1_c_0 † 4_b_1_e′_0 † 5_k′<em>h</em>0 † 6_b′<em>l</em>0 † 7_d′<em>1</em>c′_0
The Reader should take a piece of paper, and write out this solution for himself. The first line will consist of the above Data; the second must be composed, bit by bit, according to the following directions.
We begin by writing down the first Premiss, with its numeral over it, but omitting the subscripts.
We have now to find a Premiss which can be combined with this, _i.e.</em>, a Premiss containing either <em>k′</em> or <em>l</em>. The first we find is No. 5; and this we tack on, with a †.
To get the <em>Conclusion</em> from these, <em>k</em> and <em>k′</em> must be eliminated, and what remains must be taken as one expression. So we <em>underscore</em> them, putting a <em>single</em> score under <em>k</em>, and a <em>double</em> one under <em>k′</em>. The result we read as <em>l′_h</em>.
We must now find a Premiss containing either <em>l</em> or <em>h′</em>. Looking along the row, we fix on No. 2, and tack it on.
Now these 3 Nullities are really equivalent to (<em>l′_h</em> † <em>d</em>h′<em>), in which _h</em> and <em>h′</em> must be eliminated, and what remains taken as one expression. So we <em>underscore</em> them. The result reads as <em>l′_d</em>.
We now want a Premiss containing <em>l</em> or <em>d′</em>. No. 6 will do.
These 4 Nullities are really equivalent to (<em>l′_d</em> † <em>b′_l</em>). So we underscore <em>l′</em> and <em>l</em>. The result reads as <em>d</em>b′<em>.
We now want a Premiss containing _d′</em> or <em>b</em>. No. 4 will do.
Here we underscore <em>b′</em> and <em>b</em>. The result reads as <em>d</em>e′<em>.
We now want a Premiss containing _d′</em> or <em>e</em>. No. 7 will do.
Here we underscore <em>d</em> and <em>d′</em>. The result reads as <em>c′_e′</em>.
We now want a Premiss containing <em>c</em> or <em>e</em>. No. 3 will do—in fact <em>must</em> do, as it is the only one left.
Here we underscore <em>c′</em> and <em>c</em>; and, as the whole thing now reads as <em>e′_a</em>, we tack on <em>e′<em>a</em>0 as the _Conclusion</em>, with a ¶.
We now look along the row of Data, to see whether <em>e′</em> or <em>a</em> has been given as <em>existent</em>. We find that <em>a</em> has been so given in No. 3. So we add this fact to the Conclusion, which now stands as ¶ <em>e′<em>a</em>0 † <em>a</em>1, _i.e.</em> ¶ <em>a</em>1_e′<em>0; i.e. “All _a</em> are <em>e</em>.”
If the Reader has faithfully obeyed the above directions, his written solution will now stand as follows:—
1_k_1_l′<em>0 † 2_d_h′_0 † 3_a_1_c_0 † 4_b_1_e′_0 † 5_k′<em>h</em>0 † 6_b′<em>l</em>0 † 7_d′<em>1</em>c′_0
1_k_l′</em> † 5_k′<em>h</em> † 2_d_h′_ † 6_b′<em>l</em> † 4_b_e′_ † 7_d′<em>c′</em> † 3_a_c_     ¶ <em>e′<em>a</em>0 † <em>a</em>1     _i.e.</em> ¶ <em>a</em>1_e′<em>0;<br>_i.e.</em> “All <em>a</em> are <em>e</em>.”
The Reader should now take a second piece of paper, and copy the Data only, and try to work out the solution for himself, beginning with some other Premiss.
If he fails to bring out the Conclusion <em>a</em>1_e′<em>0, I would advise him to take a third piece of paper, and _begin again</em>!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I will now work out, in its briefest form, a Sorites of 5 Premisses, to serve as a model for the Reader to imitate in working examples.</p>
<p>  ”I greatly value everything that John gives me;</p>
<pre><code>Nothing but this bone will satisfy my dog;

I take particular care of everything that I greatly value;

This bone was a present from John;

The things, of which I take particular care, are things I do _not_ give to my dog”.</code></pre>
<p>Univ. “things”; <em>a</em> = given by John to me; <em>b</em> = given by me to my dog; <em>c</em> = greatly valued by me; <em>d</em> = satisfactory to my dog; <em>e</em> = taken particular care of by me; <em>h</em> = this bone.</p>
<p>i.e. “Nothing, that I give my dog, satisfies him,” or, “My dog is not satisfied with <em>anything</em> that I give him!”</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note that, in working a Sorites by this process, we may begin with <em>any</em> Premiss we choose. For instance, we might begin with No. 5, and the result would then be</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Reader, who has successfully grappled with all the Examples hitherto set, and who thirsts, like Alexander the Great, for “more worlds to conquer,” may employ his spare energies on the following 17 Examination-Papers.

<h4>CHAPTER III.</h4>
<h5><em>SOLUTIONS.</em></h5>
<h5>§ 1.</h5>
<h6><em>Propositions of Relation reduced to normal form.</em></h6>
<h6><em>Solutions for § 1.</em></h6>
<p>. The Univ. is “persons.” The Individual “I” may be regarded as a Class, of persons, whose peculiar Attribute is “represented by the Name ‘I’”, and may be called the Class of “I’s”. It is evident that this Class cannot possibly contain more than one Member: hence the Sign of Quantity is “all”. The verb “have been” may be replaced by the phrase “are persons who have been”. The Proposition may be written thus:—</p>
<p>“All”</p>
<p><em>Sign of Quantity.</em></p>
<p>“I’s”</p>
<p><em>Subject.</em></p>
<p>“are”</p>
<p><em>Copula.</em></p>
<p>“persons who have been out for a walk”</p>
<p><em>Predicate.</em></p>
<p>or, more briefly,</p>
<p>“All | I’s | are | persons who have been out for a walk”.</p>
<p>. The Univ. and the Subject are the same as in Ex. 1. The Proposition may be written</p>
<p>“All | I’s | are | persons who feel better”.</p>
<p>. Univ. is “persons”. The Subject is evidently the Class of persons from which John is <em>excluded</em>; <em>i.e.</em> it is the Class containing all persons who are <em>not</em> “John”.</p>
<p>The Sign of Quantity is “no”.</p>
<p>The verb “has read” may be replaced by the phrase “are persons who have read”.</p>
<p>The Proposition may be written</p>
<p>“No | persons who are not ‘John’ | are | persons who have read the letter”.</p>
<p>. Univ. is “persons”. The Subject is evidently the Class of persons whose only two Members are “you and I”.</p>
<p>Hence the Sign of Quantity is “no”.</p>
<p>The Proposition may be written</p>
<p>“No | Members of the Class ‘you and I’ | are | old persons”.</p>
<p>. Univ. is “creatures”. The verb “run well” may be replaced by the phrase “are creatures that run well”.</p>
<p>The Proposition may be written</p>
<p>“No | fat creatures | are | creatures that run well”.</p>
<p>. Univ. is “persons”. The Subject is evidently the Class of persons who are <em>not</em> brave.</p>
<p>The verb “deserve” may be replaced by the phrase “are deserving of”.</p>
<p>The Proposition may be written</p>
<p>“No | not-brave persons | are | persons deserving of the fair”.</p>
<p>. Univ. is “persons”. The phrase “looks poetical” evidently belongs to the <em>Predicate</em>; and the <em>Subject</em> is the Class, of persons, whose peculiar Attribute is “_not_-pale”.</p>
<p>The Proposition may be written</p>
<p>“No | not-pale persons | are | persons who look poetical”.</p>
<p>. Univ. is “persons”.</p>
<p>The Proposition may be written</p>
<p>“Some | judges | are | persons who lose their tempers”.</p>
<p>. Univ. is “persons”. The phrase “never neglect” is merely a stronger form of the phrase “am a person who does not neglect”.</p>
<p>The Proposition may be written</p>
<p>“All | ‘I’s’ | are | persons who do not neglect important business”.</p>
<p>. Univ. is “things”. The phrase “what is difficult” (<em>i.e.</em> “that which is difficult” is equivalent to the phrase “all difficult things”.</p>
<p>The Proposition may be written</p>
<p>“All | difficult things | are | things that need attention”.</p>
<p>. Univ. is “things”. The phrase “what is unwholesome” may be interpreted as in Ex. 10.</p>
<p>The Proposition may be written</p>
<p>“All | unwholesome things | are | things that should be avoided”.</p>
<p>. Univ. is “laws”. The Predicate is evidently a Class whose peculiar Attribute is “relating to excise”.</p>
<p>The Proposition may be written</p>
<p>“All | laws passed last week | are | laws relating to excise”.</p>
<p>. Univ. is “things”. The Subject is evidently the Class, of studies, whose peculiar Attribute is “logical”; hence the Sign of Quantity is “all”.</p>
<p>The Proposition may be written</p>
<p>“All | logical studies | are | things that puzzle me”.</p>
<p>. Univ. is “persons”. The Subject is evidently “persons in the house”.</p>
<p>The Proposition may be written</p>
<p>“No | persons in the house | are | Jews”.</p>
<p>. Univ. is “dishes”. The phrase “if not well-cooked” is equivalent to the Attribute “not well-cooked”.</p>
<p>The Proposition may be written</p>
<p>“Some | not well-cooked dishes | are | unwholesome dishes”.</p>
<p>. Univ. is “books”. The phrase “make one drowsy” may be replaced by the phrase “are books that make one drowsy”.</p>
<p>The Sign of Quantity is evidently “all”.</p>
<p>The Proposition may be written</p>
<p>“All | unexciting books | are | books that make one drowsy”.</p>
<p>. Univ. is “men”. The Subject is evidently “a man who knows what he’s about”; and the word “when” shows that the Proposition is asserted of <em>every</em> such man, <em>i.e.</em> of <em>all</em> such men. The verb “can” may be replaced by “are men who can”.</p>
<p>The Proposition may be written</p>
<p>“All | men who know what they’re about | are | men who can detect a sharper”.</p>
<p>. The Univ. and the Subject are the same as in Ex. 4.</p>
<p>The Proposition may be written</p>
<p>“All | Members of the Class ‘you and I’ | are | persons who know what they’re about”.</p>
<p>. Univ. is “persons”. The verb “wear” may be replaced by the phrase “are accustomed to wear”.</p>
<p>The Proposition may be written</p>
<p>“Some | bald persons | are | persons accustomed to wear wigs”.</p>
<p>. Univ. is “persons”. The phrase “never talk” is merely a stronger form of “are persons who do not talk”.</p>
<p>The Proposition may be written</p>
<p>“All | fully occupied persons | are | persons who do not talk about their grievances”.</p>
<p>. Univ. is “riddles”. The phrase “if they can be solved” is equivalent to the Attribute “that can be solved”.</p>
<p>The Proposition may be written</p>
<p>“No | riddles that can be solved | are | riddles that interest me”.</p>

<h3>NOTES.</h3>
<h5>(A \ See [p. 80</h5>
<p>One of the favourite objections, brought against the Science of Logic by its detractors, is that a Syllogism has no real validity as an argument, since it involves the Fallacy of <em>Petitio Principii</em> (i.e. “Begging the Question”, the essence of which is that the whole Conclusion is involved in <em>one</em> of the Premisses).</p>
<p>This formidable objection is refuted, with beautiful clearness and simplicity, by these three Diagrams, which show us that, in each of the three Figures, the Conclusion is really involved in the <em>two</em> Premisses taken together, each contributing its share.</p>
<p>Thus, in Fig. I., the Premiss <em>x</em>m_0 empties the <em>Inner</em> Cell of the N.W. Quarter, while the Premiss <em>y</em>m_0 empties its <em>Outer</em> Cell. Hence it needs the <em>two</em> Premisses to empty the <em>whole</em> of the N.W. Quarter, and thus to prove the Conclusion <em>x</em>y_0.</p>
<p>Again, in Fig. II., the Premiss <em>x</em>m_0 empties the Inner Cell of the N.W. Quarter. The Premiss ym1 merely tells us that the Inner Portion of the W. Half is <em>occupied</em>, so that we may place a ‘I’ in it, <em>somewhere</em>; but, if this were the <em>whole</em> of our information, we should not know in <em>which</em> Cell to place it, so that it would have to ‘sit on the fence’: it is only when we learn, from the other Premiss, that the <em>upper</em> of these two Cells is <em>empty</em>, that we feel authorised to place the ‘I’ in the <em>lower</em> Cell, and thus to prove the Conclusion x′y1.</p>
<p>Lastly, in Fig. III., the information, that <em>m</em> <em>exists</em>, merely authorises us to place a ‘I’ <em>somewhere</em> in the Inner Square——but it has large choice of fences to sit upon! It needs the Premiss <em>x</em>m_0 to drive it out of the N. Half of that Square; and it needs the Premiss <em>y</em>m_0 to drive it out of the W. Half. Hence it needs the <em>two</em> Premisses to drive it into the Inner Portion of the S.E. Quarter, and thus to prove the Conclusion _x′_y′_1.</p>

<h4>ADDRESSED TO TEACHERS.</h4>
<h5>§ 1.</h5>
<h6><em>Introductory.</em></h6>
<p>There are several matters, too hard to discuss with <em>Learners</em>, which nevertheless need to be explained to any <em>Teachers</em>, into whose hands this book may fall, in order that they may thoroughly understand what my Symbolic Method <em>is</em>, and in what respects it differs from the many other Methods already published.</p>
<p>These matters are as follows:—</p>
<p>The “Existential Import” of Propositions.<br>The use of “is-not” (or “are-not” as a Copula.</p>
<p>The theory “two Negative Premisses prove nothing.”<br>Euler’s Method of Diagrams.<br>Venn’s Method of Diagrams.<br>My Method of Diagrams.<br>The Solution of a Syllogism by various Methods.<br>My Method of treating Syllogisms and Sorites.<br>Some account of Parts II, III.</p>
<h5>§ 2.</h5>
<h6><em>The “Existential Import” of Propositions.</em></h6>
<p>The writers, and editors, of the Logical text-books which run in the ordinary grooves——to whom I shall hereafter refer by the (I hope inoffensive title “The Logicians”——take, on this subject, what seems to me to be a more humble position than is at all necessary. They speak of the Copula of a Proposition “with bated breath”, almost as if it were a living, conscious Entity, capable of declaring for itself what it chose to mean, and that we, poor human creatures, had nothing to do but to ascertain <em>what</em> was its sovereign will and pleasure, and submit to it.</p>
<p>In opposition to this view, I maintain that any writer of a book is fully authorised in attaching any meaning he likes to any word or phrase he intends to use. If I find an author saying, at the beginning of his book, “Let it be understood that by the word ‘_black_’ I shall always mean ‘_white_’, and that by the word ‘_white_’ I shall always mean ‘_black_’,” I meekly accept his ruling, however injudicious I may think it.</p>
<p>And so, with regard to the question whether a Proposition is or is not to be understood as asserting the existence of its Subject, I maintain that every writer may adopt his own rule, provided of course that it is consistent with itself and with the accepted facts of Logic.</p>
<p>Let us consider certain views that may <em>logically</em> be held, and thus settle which of them may <em>conveniently</em> be held; after which I shall hold myself free to declare which of them <em>I</em> intend to hold.</p>
<p>The <em>kinds</em> of Propositions, to be considered, are those that begin with “some”, with “no”, and with “all”. These are usually called Propositions “in <em>I</em>”, “in <em>E</em>”, and “in <em>A</em>”.</p>
<p>First, then, a Proposition in <em>I</em> may be understood as asserting, or else as <em>not</em> asserting, the existence of its Subject. (By “existence” I mean of course whatever kind of existence suits its nature. The two Propositions, “<em>dreams</em> exist” and “<em>drums</em> exist”, denote two totally different kinds of “existence”. A <em>dream</em> is an aggregate of ideas, and exists only in the <em>mind of a dreamer</em>: whereas a <em>drum</em> is an aggregate of wood and parchment, and exists in <em>the hands of a drummer</em>.)</p>
<p>First, let us suppose that <em>I</em> “asserts” (i.e. “asserts the existence of its Subject”).</p>
<p>Here, of course, we must regard a Proposition in <em>A</em> as making the <em>same</em> assertion, since it necessarily <em>contains</em> a Proposition in <em>I</em>.</p>
<p>We now have <em>I</em> and <em>A</em> “asserting”. Does this leave us free to make what supposition we choose as to <em>E</em>? My answer is “No. We are tied down to the supposition that <em>E</em> does <em>not</em> assert.” This can be proved as follows:—</p>
<p>If possible, let <em>E</em> “assert”. Then (taking <em>x</em>, <em>y</em>, and <em>z</em> to represent Attributes we see that, if the Proposition “No <em>x</em>y_ are <em>z</em>” be true, some things exist with the Attributes <em>x</em> and <em>y</em>: i.e. “Some <em>x</em> are <em>y</em>.”</p>
<p>Also we know that, if the Proposition “Some <em>x</em>y_ are <em>z</em>” be true, the same result follows.</p>
<p>But these two Propositions are Contradictories, so that one or other of them <em>must</em> be true. Hence this result is <em>always</em> true: i.e. the Proposition “Some <em>x</em> are <em>y</em>” is <em>always</em> true!</p>
<p><em>Quod est absurdum.</em> (See
.</p>
<p>We see, then, that the supposition “<em>I</em> asserts” necessarily leads to “<em>A</em> asserts, but <em>E</em> does not”. And this is the <em>first</em> of the various views that may conceivably be held.</p>
<p>Next, let us suppose that <em>I</em> does <em>not</em> “assert.” And, along with this, let us take the supposition that <em>E</em> <em>does</em> “assert.”</p>
<p>Hence the Proposition “No <em>x</em> are <em>y</em>” means “Some <em>x</em> exist, and none of them are <em>y</em>”: i.e. “<em>all</em> of them are <em>not_-_y</em>,” which is a Proposition in <em>A</em>. We also know, of course, that the Proposition “All <em>x</em> are not-<em>y</em>” proves “No <em>x</em> are <em>y</em>.” Now two Propositions, each of which proves the other, are <em>equivalent</em>. Hence every Proposition in <em>A</em> is equivalent to one in <em>E</em>, and therefore “_asserts_”.</p>
<p>Hence our <em>second</em> conceivable view is “<em>E</em> and <em>A</em> assert, but <em>I</em> does not.”</p>
<p>This view does not seen to involve any necessary contradiction with itself or with the accepted facts of Logic. But, when we come to <em>test</em> it, as applied to the actual <em>facts</em> of life, we shall find I think, that it fits in with them so badly that its adoption would be, to say the least of it, singularly inconvenient for ordinary folk.</p>
<p>Let me record a little dialogue I have just held with my friend Jones, who is trying to form a new Club, to be regulated on strictly <em>Logical</em> principles.</p>
<p><em>Author.</em> “Well, Jones! Have you got your new Club started yet?”</p>
<p><em>Jones</em> (<em>rubbing his hands</em>). “You’ll be glad to hear that some of the Members (mind, I only say ‘_some_’ are millionaires! Rolling in gold, my boy!”</p>
<p><em>Author.</em> “That sounds well. And how many Members have entered?”</p>
<p><em>Jones</em> (<em>staring</em>). “None at all. We haven’t got it started yet. What makes you think we have?”</p>
<p><em>Author.</em> “Why, I thought you said that some of the Members——”</p>
<p><em>Jones</em> (<em>contemptuously</em>). “You don’t seem to be aware that we’re working on strictly <em>Logical</em> principles. A <em>Particular</em> Proposition does <em>not</em> assert the existence of its Subject. I merely meant to say that we’ve made a Rule not to admit <em>any</em> Members till we have at least <em>three</em> Candidates whose incomes are over ten thousand a year!”</p>
<p><em>Author.</em> “Oh, <em>that’s</em> what you meant, is it? Let’s hear some more of your Rules.”</p>
<p><em>Jones.</em> “Another is, that no one, who has been convicted seven times of forgery, is admissible.”</p>
<p><em>Author.</em> “And here, again, I suppose you don’t mean to assert there <em>are</em> any such convicts in existence?”</p>
<p><em>Jones.</em> “Why, that’s exactly what I <em>do</em> mean to assert! Don’t you know that a Universal Negative <em>asserts</em> the existence of its Subject? <em>Of course</em> we didn’t make that Rule till we had satisfied ourselves that there are several such convicts now living.”</p>
<p>The Reader can now decide for himself how far this <em>second</em> conceivable view would fit in with the facts of life. He will, I think, agree with me that Jones’ view, of the ‘Existential Import’ of Propositions, would lead to some inconvenience.</p>
<p>Thirdly, let us suppose that neither <em>I</em> nor <em>E</em> “asserts”.</p>
<p>Now the supposition that the two Propositions, “Some <em>x</em> are <em>y</em>” and “No <em>x</em> are not-<em>y</em>”, do <em>not</em> “assert”, necessarily involves the supposition that “All <em>x</em> are <em>y</em>” does <em>not</em> “assert”, since it would be absurd to suppose that they assert, when combined, more than they do when taken separately.</p>
<p>Hence the <em>third</em> (and last of the conceivable views is that neither <em>I</em>, nor <em>E</em>, nor <em>A</em>, “asserts”.</p>
<p>The advocates of this third view would interpret the Proposition “Some <em>x</em> are <em>y</em>” to mean “If there <em>were</em> any <em>x</em> in existence, some of them <em>would</em> be <em>y</em>”; and so with <em>E</em> and <em>A</em>.</p>
<p>It admits of proof that this view, as regards <em>A</em>, conflicts with the accepted facts of Logic.</p>
<p>Let us take the Syllogism <em>Darapti</em>, which is universally accepted as valid. Its form is</p>
<p>“All <em>m</em> are <em>x</em>;  
  All <em>m</em> are <em>y</em>.  
          ∴ Some <em>y</em> are <em>x</em>”.</p>
<p>This they would interpret as follows:—</p>
<p>”If there were any <em>m</em> in existence, all of them would be <em>x</em>;  
  If there were any <em>m</em> in existence, all of them would be <em>y</em>.  
          ∴ If there were any <em>y</em> in existence, some of them would be <em>x</em>”.</p>
<p>That this Conclusion does <em>not</em> follow has been so briefly and clearly explained by Mr. Keynes (in his “Formal Logic”, dated 1894, pp. 356, 357), that I prefer to quote his words:—</p>
<p>“<em>Let no proposition imply the existence either of its subject or of its predicate.</em></p>
<p>“Take, as an example, a syllogism in <em>Darapti</em>:—</p>
<p>‘<em>All M is P</em>,  
  <em>All M is S</em>,  
          <em>∴ Some S is P</em>.’</p>
<p>“Taking <em>S</em>, <em>M</em>, <em>P</em>, as the minor, middle, and major terms respectively, the conclusion will imply that, if there is an <em>S</em>, there is some <em>P</em>. Will the premisses also imply this? If so, then the syllogism is valid; but not otherwise.</p>
<p>“The conclusion implies that if <em>S</em> exists <em>P</em> exists; but, consistently with the premisses, <em>S</em> may be existent while <em>M</em> and <em>P</em> are both non-existent. An implication is, therefore, contained in the conclusion, which is not justified by the premisses.”</p>
<p>This seems to <em>me</em> entirely clear and convincing. Still, “to make sicker”, I may as well throw the above (<em>soi-disant</em> Syllogism into a concrete form, which will be within the grasp of even a _non_-logical Reader.</p>
<p>Let us suppose that a Boys’ School has been set up, with the following system of Rules:—</p>
<p>“All boys in the First (the highest Class are to do French, Greek, and Latin. All in the Second Class are to do Greek only. All in the Third Class are to do Latin only.”</p>
<p>Suppose also that there <em>are</em> boys in the Third Class, and in the Second; but that no boy has yet risen into the First.</p>
<p>It is evident that there are no boys in the School doing French: still we know, by the Rules, what would happen if there <em>were</em> any.</p>
<p>We are authorised, then, by the <em>Data</em>, to assert the following two Propositions:—</p>
<p>“If there were any boys doing French, all of them would be doing Greek;<br>  If there were any boys doing French, all of them would be doing Latin.”</p>
<p>And the Conclusion, according to “The Logicians” would be</p>
<p>“If there were any boys doing Latin, some of them would be doing Greek.”</p>
<p>Here, then, we have two <em>true</em> Premisses and a <em>false</em> Conclusion (since we know that there <em>are</em> boys doing Latin, and that <em>none</em> of them are doing Greek). Hence the argument is <em>invalid</em>.</p>
<p>Similarly it may be shown that this “non-existential” interpretation destroys the validity of <em>Disamis</em>, <em>Datisi</em>, <em>Felapton</em>, and <em>Fresison</em>.</p>
<p>Some of “The Logicians” will, no doubt, be ready to reply “But we are not <em>Aldrichians</em>! Why should <em>we</em> be responsible for the validity of the Syllogisms of so antiquated an author as Aldrich?”</p>
<p>Very good. Then, for the <em>special</em> benefit of these “friends” of mine (with what ominous emphasis that name is sometimes used! “I must have a private interview with <em>you</em>, my young <em>friend</em>,” says the bland Dr. Birch, “in my library, at 9 a.m. tomorrow. And you will please to be <em>punctual</em>!”), for their <em>special</em> benefit, I say, I will produce <em>another</em> charge against this “non-existential” interpretation.</p>
<p>It actually invalidates the ordinary Process of “Conversion”, as applied to Proposition in ‘<em>I</em>’.</p>
<p><em>Every</em> logician, Aldrichian or otherwise, accepts it as an established fact that “Some <em>x</em> are <em>y</em>” may be legitimately converted into “Some <em>y</em> are <em>x</em>.”</p>
<p>But is it equally clear that the Proposition “If there <em>were</em> any <em>x</em>, some of them <em>would</em> be <em>y</em>” may be legitimately converted into “If there <em>were</em> any <em>y</em>, some of them would be <em>x</em>”? I trow not.</p>
<p>The example I have already used——of a Boys’ School with a non-existent First Class——will serve admirably to illustrate this new flaw in the theory of “The Logicians.”</p>
<p>Let us suppose that there is yet <em>another</em> Rule in this School, viz. “In each Class, at the end of the Term, the head boy and the second boy shall receive prizes.”</p>
<p>This Rule entirely authorises us to assert (in the sense in which “The Logicians” would use the words “Some boys in the First Class will receive prizes”, for this simply means (according to them “If there <em>were</em> any boys in the First Class, some of them <em>would</em> receive prizes.”</p>
<p>Now the Converse of this Proposition is, of course, “Some boys, who will receive prizes, are in the First Class”, which means (according to “The Logicians” “If there <em>were</em> any boys about to receive prizes, some of them <em>would</em> be in the First Class” (which Class we know to be <em>empty</em>).</p>
<p>Of this Pair of Converse Propositions, the first is undoubtedly <em>true</em>: the second, <em>as</em> undoubtedly, <em>false</em>.</p>
<p>It is always sad to see a batsman knock down his own wicket: one pities him, as a man and a brother, but, as a <em>cricketer</em>, one can but pronounce him “Out!”</p>
<p>We see, then, that, among all the conceivable views we have here considered, there are only <em>two</em> which can <em>logically</em> be held, viz.</p>
<p><em>I</em> and <em>A</em> “assert”, but <em>E</em> does not.<br><em>E</em> and <em>A</em> “assert”, but <em>I</em> does not.</p>
<p>The <em>second</em> of these I have shown to involve great practical inconvenience.</p>
<p>The <em>first</em> is the one adopted in this book. (See .)</p>
<p>Some further remarks on this subject will be found in .</p>
<h5>§ 3.</h5>
<h6><em>The use of “is-not” (or “are-not” as a Copula.</em></h6>
<p>Is it better to say “John <em>is-not</em> in-the-house” or “John <em>is</em> not-in-the-house”? “Some of my acquaintances <em>are-not</em> men-I-should-like-to-be-seen-with” or “Some of my acquaintances <em>are</em> men-I-should-_not_-like-to-be-seen-with”? That is the sort of question we have now to discuss.</p>
<p>This is no question of Logical Right and Wrong: it is merely a matter of <em>taste</em>, since the two forms mean exactly the same thing. And here, again, “The Logicians” seem to me to take much too humble a position. When they are putting the final touches to the grouping of their Proposition, just before the curtain goes up, and when the Copula——always a rather fussy ‘heavy father’, asks them “Am <em>I</em> to have the ‘not’, or will you tack it on to the Predicate?” they are much too ready to answer, like the subtle cab-driver, “Leave it to <em>you</em>, Sir!” The result seems to be, that the grasping Copula constantly gets a “not” that had better have been merged in the Predicate, and that Propositions are differentiated which had better have been recognised as precisely similar. Surely it is simpler to treat “Some men are Jews” and “Some men are Gentiles” as being both of them, <em>affirmative</em> Propositions, instead of translating the latter into “Some men are-not Jews”, and regarding it as a <em>negative</em> Propositions?</p>
<p>The fact is, “The Logicians” have somehow acquired a perfectly <em>morbid</em> dread of negative Attributes, which makes them shut their eyes, like frightened children, when they come across such terrible Propositions as “All not-x are y”; and thus they exclude from their system many very useful forms of Syllogisms.</p>
<p>Under the influence of this unreasoning terror, they plead that, in Dichotomy by Contradiction, the <em>negative</em> part is too large to deal with, so that it is better to regard each Thing as either included in, or excluded from, the <em>positive</em> part. I see no force in this plea: and the facts often go the other way. As a personal question, dear Reader, if <em>you</em> were to group your acquaintances into the two Classes, men that you <em>would</em> like to be seen with, and men that you would <em>not</em> like to be seen with, do you think the latter group would be so <em>very</em> much the larger of the two?</p>
<p>For the purposes of Symbolic Logic, it is so <em>much</em> the most convenient plan to regard the two sub-divisions, produced by Dichotomy, on the <em>same</em> footing, and to say, of any Thing, either that it “is” in the one, or that it “is” in the other, that I do not think any Reader of this book is likely to demur to my adopting that course.</p>
<h5>§ 4.</h5>
<h6><em>The theory that “two Negative Premisses prove nothing”.</em></h6>
<p>This I consider to be <em>another</em> craze of “The Logicians”, fully as morbid as their dread of a negative Attribute.</p>
<p>It is, perhaps, best refuted by the method of <em>Instantia Contraria</em>.</p>
<p>Take the following Pairs of Premisses:—</p>
<p>“None of my boys are conceited;<br>  None of my girls are greedy”.</p>
<p>“None of my boys are clever;<br>  None but a clever boy could solve this problem”.</p>
<p>“None of my boys are learned;<br>  Some of my boys are not choristers”.</p>
<p>This last Proposition is, in <em>my</em> system, an <em>affirmative</em> one, since I should read it “are not-choristers”; but, in dealing with “The Logicians,” I may fairly treat it as a <em>negative</em> one, since <em>they</em> would read it “are-not choristers”.)</p>
<p>If you, dear Reader, declare, after full consideration of these Pairs of Premisses, that you cannot deduce a Conclusion from <em>any</em> of them——why, all I can say is that, like the Duke in Patience, you “will have to be contented with our heart-felt sympathy”! .</p>
<h5>§ 5.</h5>
<h6><em>Euler’s Method of Diagrams.</em></h6>
<p>Diagrams seem to have been used, at first, to represent <em>Propositions</em> only. In Euler’s well-known Circles, each was supposed to contain a class, and the Diagram consisted of two circles, which exhibited the relations, as to inclusion and exclusion, existing between the two Classes.</p>


<img class="overlay" width="100%" height="100%" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marvindanig/symbolic-logic/master/assets/images/append01.png" alt="Diagram of circle x inside circle y">
<p>Thus, the Diagram, here given, exhibits the two Classes, whose respective Attributes are <em>x</em> and <em>y</em>, as so related to each other that the following Propositions are all simultaneously true:—“All <em>x</em> are <em>y</em>”, “No <em>x</em> are not-<em>y</em>”, “Some <em>x</em> are <em>y</em>”, “Some <em>y</em> are not-<em>x</em>”, “Some not-<em>y</em> are not-<em>x</em>”, and, of course, the Converses of the last four.</p>


<img class="overlay" width="100%" height="100%" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marvindanig/symbolic-logic/master/assets/images/append02.png" alt="Diagram of circle y inside circle x">
<p>Similarly, with this Diagram, the following Propositions are true:—“All <em>y</em> are <em>x</em>”, “No <em>y</em> are not-<em>x</em>”, “Some <em>y</em> are <em>x</em>”, “Some <em>x</em> are not-<em>y</em>”, “Some not-<em>x</em> are not-<em>y</em>”, and, of course, the Converses of the last four.</p>


<img class="overlay" width="100%" height="100%" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marvindanig/symbolic-logic/master/assets/images/append03.png" alt="Diagram of two separate circles x and y">
<p>Similarly, with this Diagram, the following are true:—“All <em>x</em> are not-<em>y</em>”, “All <em>y</em> are not-<em>x</em>”, “No <em>x</em> are <em>y</em>”, “Some <em>x</em> are not-<em>y</em>”, “Some <em>y</em> are not-<em>x</em>”, “Some not-<em>x</em> are not-<em>y</em>”, and the Converses of the last four.</p>


<img class="overlay" width="100%" height="100%" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marvindanig/symbolic-logic/master/assets/images/append04.png" alt="Diagram of two intersecting circles x and y">
<p>Similarly, with this Diagram, the following are true:—“Some <em>x</em> are <em>y</em>”, “Some <em>x</em> are not-<em>y</em>”, “Some not-<em>x</em> are <em>y</em>”, “Some not-<em>x</em> are not-<em>y</em>”, and of course, their four Converses.</p>
<p>Note that <em>all</em> Euler’s Diagrams assert “Some not-<em>x</em> are not-<em>y</em>.” Apparently it never occured to him that it might <em>sometimes</em> fail to be true!</p>
<p>Now, to represent “All <em>x</em> are <em>y</em>”, the <em>first</em> of these Diagrams would suffice. Similarly, to represent “No <em>x</em> are <em>y</em>”, the <em>third</em> would suffice. But to represent any <em>Particular</em> Proposition, at least <em>three</em> Diagrams would be needed (in order to include all the possible cases), and, for “Some not-<em>x</em> are not-<em>y</em>”, all the <em>four</em>.</p>
<h5>§ 6.</h5>
<h6><em>Venn’s Method of Diagrams.</em></h6>
<p>Let us represent “not-<em>x</em>” by “_x′_”.</p>
<p>Mr. Venn’s Method of Diagrams is a great advance on the above Method.</p>
<p>He uses the last of the above Diagrams to represent <em>any</em> desired relation between <em>x</em> and <em>y</em>, by simply shading a Compartment known to be <em>empty</em>, and placing a + in one known to be <em>occupied</em>.</p>
<p>Thus, he would represent the three Propositions “Some <em>x</em> are <em>y</em>”, “No <em>x</em> are <em>y</em>”, and “All <em>x</em> are <em>y</em>”, as follows:—</p>


<img class="overlay" width="100%" height="100%" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marvindanig/symbolic-logic/master/assets/images/append05.png" alt="Venn diagram representing x y exists">


<img class="overlay" width="100%" height="100%" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marvindanig/symbolic-logic/master/assets/images/append06.png" alt="Venn diagram representing x y does not exist">


<img class="overlay" width="100%" height="100%" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marvindanig/symbolic-logic/master/assets/images/append07.png" alt="Venn diagram representing all x are y">
<p>It will be seen that, of the <em>four</em> Classes, whose peculiar Sets of Attributes are <em>x</em>y_, <em>x</em>y′<em>, _x′_y</em>, and <em>x′_y′</em>, only <em>three</em> are here provided with closed Compartments, while the <em>fourth</em> is allowed the rest of the Infinite Plane to range about in!</p>
<p>This arrangement would involve us in very serious trouble, if we ever attempted to represent “No <em>x′</em> are <em>y′</em>.” Mr. Venn <em>once</em> (at p. 281 encounters this awful task; but evades it, in a quite masterly fashion, by the simple foot-note “We have not troubled to shade the outside of this diagram”!</p>
<p>To represent <em>two</em> Propositions (containing a common Term <em>together</em>, a _three_-letter Diagram is needed. This is the one used by Mr. Venn.</p>


<img class="overlay" width="100%" height="100%" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marvindanig/symbolic-logic/master/assets/images/append08.png" alt="Venn diagram of three intersecting circles x y and z">
<p>Here, again, we have only <em>seven</em> closed Compartments, to accommodate the <em>eight</em> Classes whose peculiar Sets of Attributes are <em>x</em>y_m_, <em>x</em>y_m′_, &amp;c.</p>
<p>“With four terms in request,” Mr. Venn says, “the most simple and symmetrical diagram seems to me that produced by making four ellipses intersect one another in the desired manner”. This, however, provides only <em>fifteen</em> closed compartments.</p>


<img class="overlay" width="100%" height="100%" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marvindanig/symbolic-logic/master/assets/images/append09.png" alt="Venn diagram of four intersecting ellipses a b c and d">
<p>For <em>five</em> letters, “the simplest diagram I can suggest,” Mr. Venn says, “is one like this (the small ellipse in the centre is to be regarded as a portion of the <em>outside</em> of <em>c</em>; i.e. its four component portions are inside <em>b</em> and <em>d</em> but are no part of <em>c</em>). It must be admitted that such a diagram is not quite so simple to draw as one might wish it to be; but then consider what the alternative is of one undertakes to deal with five terms and all their combinations—nothing short of the disagreeable task of writing out, or in some way putting before us, all the 32 combinations involved.”</p>


<img class="overlay" width="100%" height="100%" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marvindanig/symbolic-logic/master/assets/images/append10.png" alt="Venn diagram of five intersecting ellipses a b c d and e and an interior ellipse">
<p>This Diagram gives us 31 closed compartments.</p>
<p>For <em>six</em> letters, Mr. Venn suggests that we might use <em>two</em> Diagrams, like the above, one for the <em>f</em>-part, and the other for the not-<em>f</em>-part, of all the other combinations. “This”, he says, “would give the desired 64 subdivisions.” This, however, would only give 62 closed Compartments, and <em>one</em> infinite area, which the two Classes, <em>a′_b′_c′_d′_e′_f</em> and <em>a′_b′_c′_d′_e′_f′</em>, would have to share between them.</p>
<p>Beyond <em>six</em> letters Mr. Venn does not go.</p>
<h5>§ 7.</h5>
<h6><em>My Method of Diagrams.</em></h6>
<p>My Method of Diagrams <em>resembles</em> Mr. Venn’s, in having separate Compartments assigned to the various Classes, and in marking these Compartments as <em>occupied</em> or as <em>empty</em>; but it <em>differs</em> from his Method, in assigning a <em>closed</em> area to the <em>Universe of Discourse</em>, so that the Class which, under Mr. Venn’s liberal sway, has been ranging at will through Infinite Space, is suddenly dismayed to find itself “cabin’d, cribb’d, confined”, in a limited Cell like any other Class! Also I use <em>rectilinear</em>, instead of <em>curvilinear</em>, Figures; and I mark an <em>occupied</em> Cell with a ‘I’ (meaning that there is at least <em>one</em> Thing in it), and an <em>empty</em> Cell with a ‘O’ (meaning that there is <em>no</em> Thing in it).</p>
<p>For <em>two</em> letters, I use this Diagram, in which the North Half is assigned to ‘<em>x</em>’, the South to ‘not-<em>x</em>’ (or ‘<em>x′_’), the West to _y</em>, and the East to <em>y′</em>. Thus the N.W. Cell contains the <em>x</em>y_-Class, the N.E. Cell the <em>x</em>y′_-Class, and so on.</p>


<img class="overlay" width="100%" height="100%" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marvindanig/symbolic-logic/master/assets/images/append11.png" alt="Empty biliteral diagram">
<p>For <em>three</em> letters, I subdivide these four Cells, by drawing an <em>Inner</em> Square, which I assign to <em>m</em>, the <em>Outer</em> Border being assigned to <em>m′</em>. I thus get <em>eight</em> Cells that are needed to accommodate the eight Classes, whose peculiar Sets of Attributes are <em>x</em>y_m_, <em>x</em>y_m′_, &amp;c.</p>

<p>This last Diagram is the most complex that I use in the <em>Elementary</em> Part of my ‘Symbolic Logic.’ But I may as well take this opportunity of describing the more complex ones which will appear in Part II.</p>
<p>For <em>four</em> letters (which I call <em>a</em>, <em>b</em>, <em>c</em>, <em>d</em> I use this Diagram; assigning the North Half to <em>a</em> (and of course the <em>rest</em> of the Diagram to <em>a′</em>), the West Half to <em>b</em>, the Horizontal Oblong to <em>c</em>, and the Upright Oblong to <em>d</em>. We have now got 16 Cells.</p>

<p>For <em>five</em> letters (adding e I subdivide the 16 Cells of the previous Diagram by <em>oblique</em> partitions, assigning all the <em>upper</em> portions to <em>e</em>, and all the <em>lower</em> portions to <em>e′</em>. Here, I admit, we lose the advantage of having the <em>e</em>-Class all <em>together</em>, “in a ring-fence”, like the other 4 Classes. Still, it is very easy to find; and the operation, of erasing it, is nearly as easy as that of erasing any other Class. We have now got 32 Cells.</p>


<img class="overlay" width="100%" height="100%" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marvindanig/symbolic-logic/master/assets/images/append14.png" alt="Empty pentaliteral diagram">
<p>For <em>six</em> letters (adding <em>h</em>, as I avoid <em>tailed</em> letters I substitute upright crosses for the oblique partitions, assigning the 4 portions, into which each of the 16 Cells is thus divided, to the four Classes <em>e</em>h_, <em>e</em>h′<em>, _e′_h</em>, <em>e′_h′</em>. We have now got 64 Cells.</p>


<img class="overlay" width="100%" height="100%" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marvindanig/symbolic-logic/master/assets/images/append15.png" alt="Empty hexaliteral diagram">
<p>For <em>seven</em> letters (adding <em>k</em> I add, to each upright cross, a little inner square. All these 16 little squares are assigned to the <em>k</em>-Class, and all outside them to the <em>k′_-Class; so that 8 little Cells (into which each of the 16 Cells is divided are respectively assigned to the 8 Classes <em>e</em>h_k</em>, <em>e</em>h_k′_, &amp;c. We have now got 128 Cells.</p>

Thus, the lattice in the N.W. corner serves to accommodate the 16 Classes <em>a</em>b_c′<em>d′<em>e</em>h_k_l</em>, <em>a</em>b_c′<em>d′<em>e</em>h′<em>k</em>l′</em>, &amp;c. This Octoliteral Diagram (see  next page contains 256 Cells.</p>

<h5>§ 8.</h5>
<h6><em>Solution of a Syllogism by various Methods.</em></h6>
<p>The best way, I think, to exhibit the differences between these various Methods of solving Syllogisms, will be to take a concrete example, and solve it by each Method in turn. Let us take, as our example,  No. 29](#ex5q29 (see [p. 102 </p>
<p>“No philosophers are conceited;<br>  Some conceited persons are not gamblers.<br>  ∴ Some persons, who are not gamblers, are not philosophers.”</p>
<p>  <em>Solution by ordinary Method.</em></p>
<p>These Premisses, as they stand, will give no Conclusion, as they are both negative.</p>
<p>If by ‘Permutation’ or ‘Obversion’, we write the Minor Premiss thus,</p>
<p>‘Some conceited persons are not-gamblers,’</p>
<p>we can get a Conclusion in <em>Fresison</em>, viz.</p>
<p>“No philosophers are conceited;<br>  Some conceited persons are not-gamblers.<br>  ∴ Some not-gamblers are not philosophers”</p>
<p>This can be proved by reduction to <em>Ferio</em>, thus:—</p>
<p>“No conceited persons are philosophers;<br>  Some not-gamblers are conceited.<br>  ∴ Some not-gamblers are not philosophers”.</p>
<p>The validity of <em>Ferio</em> follows directly from the Axiom ‘_De Omni et Nullo_’.</p>
<p>  <em>Symbolic Representation.</em></p>
<p>Before proceeding to discuss other Methods of Solution, it is necessary to translate our Syllogism into an <em>abstract</em> form.</p>
<p>Let us take “persons” as our ‘Universe of Discourse’; and let <em>x</em> = “philosophers”, <em>m</em> = “conceited”, and <em>y</em> = “gamblers.”</p>
<p>Then the Syllogism may be written thus:—</p>
<p>“No <em>x</em> are <em>m</em>;  
  Some <em>m</em> are <em>y′</em>.  
  ∴ Some <em>y′</em> are <em>x′</em>.”</p>
<p>  <em>Solution by Euler’s Method of Diagrams.</em></p>
<p>The Major Premiss requires only <em>one</em> Diagram, viz.</p>

<p>where the only Proposition, represented by them all, is “Some not-<em>y</em> are not-<em>x</em>,” i.e. “Some persons, who are not gamblers, are not philosophers”——a result which Euler would hardly have regarded as a <em>valuable</em> one, since he seems to have assumed that a Proposition of this form is <em>always</em> true!</p>
<p>  <em>Solution by Venn’s Method of Diagrams.</em></p>
<p>The following Solution has been kindly supplied to me Mr. Venn himself.</p>
<p>”The Minor Premiss declares that some of the constituents in <em>m</em>y′_ must be saved: mark these constituents with a cross.</p>


<img class="overlay" width="100%" height="100%" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marvindanig/symbolic-logic/master/assets/images/append36.png" alt="Venn diagram of three intersecting circles">
<p>The Major declares that all <em>x</em>m_ must be destroyed; erase it.</p>
<p>Then, as some <em>m</em>y′_ is to be saved, it must clearly be <em>m</em>y′<em>x′</em>. That is, there must exist <em>m</em>y′<em>x′</em>; or eliminating <em>m</em>, <em>y′_x′</em>. In common phraseology,</p>
<p>‘Some <em>y′</em> are <em>x′</em>,’ or, ‘Some not-gamblers are not-philosophers.’”</p>
<p>  <em>Solution by my Method of Diagrams.</em></p>
<p>The first Premiss asserts that no <em>x</em>m_ exist: so we mark the <em>x</em>m_-Compartment as empty, by placing a ‘O’ in each of its Cells.</p>
<p>The second asserts that some <em>m</em>y′_ exist: so we mark the <em>m</em>y′_-Compartment as occupied, by placing a ‘I’ in its only available Cell.</p>

<p>The only information, that this gives us as to <em>x</em> and <em>y</em>, is that the <em>x′_y′_-Compartment is _occupied</em>, i.e. that some <em>x′_y′</em> exist.</p>
<p>Hence “Some <em>x′</em> are _y′_”: i.e. “Some persons, who are not philosophers, are not gamblers”.</p>
<p>  <em>Solution by my Method of Subscripts.</em></p>
<p><em>x</em>m_0 † <em>m</em>y′_1 ¶ _x′_y′_1</p>

<h5>§ 9.</h5>
<h6><em>My Method of treating Syllogisms and Sorites.</em></h6>
<p>Of all the strange things, that are to be met with in the ordinary text-books of Formal Logic, perhaps the strangest is the violent contrast one finds to exist between their ways of dealing with these two subjects. While they have elaborately discussed no less than <em>nineteen</em> different forms of <em>Syllogisms_——each with its own special and exasperating Rules, while the whole constitute an almost useless machine, for practical purposes, many of the Conclusions being incomplete, and many quite legitimate forms being ignored——they have limited _Sorites</em> to <em>two</em> forms only, of childish simplicity; and these they have dignified with special <em>names</em>, apparently under the impression that no other possible forms existed!</p>
<p>As to <em>Syllogisms</em>, I find that their nineteen forms, with about a score of others which they have ignored, can all be arranged under <em>three</em> forms, each with a very simple Rule of its own; and the only question the Reader has to settle, in working any one of the 101 Examples given at  p. 101 </p>
<p>As to <em>Sorites</em>, the only two forms, recognised by the text-books, are the <em>Aristotelian</em>, whose Premisses are a series of Propositions in <em>A</em>, so arranged that the Predicate of each is the Subject of the next, and the <em>Goclenian</em>, whose Premisses are the very same series, written backwards. Goclenius, it seems, was the first who noticed the startling fact that it does not affect the force of a Syllogism to invert the order of its Premisses, and who applied this discovery to a Sorites. If we assume (as surely we may? that he is the <em>same</em> man as that transcendent genius who first noticed that 4 times 5 is the same thing as 5 times 4, we may apply to him what somebody (Edmund Yates, I think it was has said of Tupper, viz., “here is a man who, beyond all others of his generation, has been favoured with Glimpses of the Obvious!”</p>
<p>These puerile——not to say infantine——forms of a Sorites I have, in this book, ignored from the very first, and have not only admitted freely Propositions in <em>E</em>, but have purposely stated the Premisses in random order, leaving to the Reader the useful task of arranging them, for himself, in an order which can be worked as a series of regular Syllogisms. In doing this, he can begin with <em>any one</em> of them he likes.</p>
<p>I have tabulated, for curiosity, the various orders in which the Premisses of the Aristotelian Sorites</p>
<p> All <em>a</em> are <em>b</em>;  
 All <em>b</em> are <em>c</em>;  
 All <em>c</em> are <em>d</em>;  
 All <em>d</em> are <em>e</em>;  
 All <em>e</em> are <em>h</em>.  
  ∴ All <em>a</em> are <em>h</em>.</p>
<p>may be syllogistically arranged, and I find there are no less than <em>sixteen</em> such orders, viz., 12345, 21345, 23145, 23415, 23451, 32145, 32415, 32451, 34215, 34251, 34521, 43215, 43251, 43521, 45321, 54321. Of these the <em>first</em> and the <em>last</em> have been dignified with names; but the other _fourteen_——first enumerated by an obscure Writer on Logic, towards the end of the Nineteenth Century——remain without a name!</p>
<h5>§ 10.</h5>
<h6><em>Some account of Parts II, III.</em></h6>
<p>In Part II. will be found some of the matters mentioned in this Appendix, viz., the “Existential Import” of Propositions, the use of a <em>negative</em> Copula, and the theory that “two negative Premisses prove nothing.” I shall also extend the range of Syllogisms, by introducing Propositions containing alternatives (such as “Not-all <em>x</em> are <em>y</em>”), Propositions containing 3 or more Terms (such as “All <em>a</em>b_ are <em>c</em>”, which, taken along with “Some <em>b</em>c′_ are <em>d</em>”, would prove “Some <em>d</em> are <em>a′_”), &amp;c. I shall also discuss Sorites containing Entities, and the _very</em> puzzling subjects of Hypotheticals and Dilemmas. I hope, in the course of Part II., to go over all the ground usually traversed in the text-books used in our Schools and Universities, and to enable my Readers to solve Problems of the same kind as, and far harder than, those that are at present set in their Examinations.</p>
<p>In Part III. I hope to deal with many curious and out-of-the-way subjects, some of which are not even alluded to in any of the treatises I have met with. In this Part will be found such matters as the Analysis of Propositions into their Elements (let the Reader, who has never gone into this branch of the subject, try to make out for himself what <em>additional</em> Proposition would be needed to convert “Some <em>a</em> are <em>b</em>” into “Some <em>a</em> are <em>b</em>c_”), the treatment of Numerical and Geometrical Problems, the construction of Problems, and the solution of Syllogisms and Sorites containing Propositions more complex than any that I have used in Part II.</p>
<p>I will conclude with eight Problems, as a taste of what is coming in Part II. I shall be very glad to receive, from any Reader, who thinks he has solved any one of them (more especially if he has done so <em>without</em> using any Method of Symbols), what he conceives to be its complete Conclusion.</p>
<p>It may be well to explain what I mean by the <em>complete</em> Conclusion of a Syllogism or a Sorites. I distinguish their Terms as being of two kinds——those which <em>can</em> be eliminated (e.g. the Middle Term of a Syllogism), which I call the “Eliminands,” and those which <em>cannot</em>, which I call the “Retinends”; and I do not call the Conclusion <em>complete</em>, unless it states <em>all</em> the relations among the Retinends only, which can be deduced from the Premisses.</p>

<p>Six friends, and their six wives, are staying in the same hotel; and they all walk out daily, in parties of various size and composition. To ensure variety in these daily walks, they have agree to observe the following Rules:—</p>
<p>  If Acres is with (i.e. is in the same party with his wife, and Barry with his, and Eden with Mrs. Hall, Cole must be with Mrs. Dix;</p>
<p>  If Acres is with his wife, and Hall with his, and Barry with Mrs. Cole, Dix must <em>not</em> be with Mrs. Eden;</p>

<p>  If Barry and Cole and their wives are all in the same party, and Eden <em>not</em> with Mrs. Hall, Dix must be with Mrs. Eden.</p>
<p>The Problem is to prove that there must be, every day, at least <em>one</em> married couple who are not in the same party.</p>
<h6>.</h6>
<p>After the six friends, named in Problem 5, had returned from their tour, three of them, Barry, Cole, and Dix, agreed, with two other friends of theirs, Lang and Mill, that the five should meet, every day, at a certain <em>table d’hôte</em>. Remembering how much amusement they had derived from their code of rules for walking-parties, they devised the following rules to be observed whenever beef appeared on the table:—</p>
<p>  If Barry takes salt, then either Cole or Lang takes <em>one</em> only of the two condiments, salt and mustard: if he takes mustard, then either Dix takes neither condiment, or Mill takes both.</p>
<p>  If Cole takes salt, then either Barry takes only <em>one</em> condiment, or Mill takes neither: if he takes mustard, then either Dix or Lang takes both.</p>
<p>  If Dix takes salt, then either Barry takes neither condiment or Cole take both: if he takes mustard, then either Lang or Mill takes neither.</p>
<p>  If Lang takes salt, then Barry or Dix takes only <em>one</em> condiment: if he takes mustard, then either Cole or Mill takes neither.</p>
<p>  If Mill takes salt, then either Barry or Lang takes both condiments: if he takes mustard, then either Cole or Dix takes only <em>one</em>.</p>
<p>The Problem is to discover whether these rules are <em>compatible</em>; and, if so, what arrangements are possible.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>N.B. In this Problem, it is assumed that the phrase “if Barry takes salt” allows of <em>two</em> possible cases, viz. (1 “he takes salt <em>only_”; (2 “he takes _both</em> condiments”. And so with all similar phrases.
It is also assumed that the phrase “either Cole or Lang takes <em>one</em> only of the two condiments” allows <em>three</em> possible cases, viz. (1 “Cole takes <em>one</em> only, Lang takes both or neither”; (2 “Cole takes both or neither, Lang takes <em>one</em> only”; (3 “Cole takes <em>one</em> only, Lang takes <em>one</em> only”. And so with all similar phrases.
It is also assumed that every rule is to be understood as implying the words “and <em>vice versâ</em>.” Thus the first rule would imply the addition “and, if either Cole or Lang takes only <em>one</em> condiment, then Barry takes salt.”</p>

<p>Solve this as a Sorites-Problem, taking lines 3 and 4 as the Conclusion to be proved. It is permitted to use, as Premisses, not only all that is here <em>asserted</em>, but also all that we may reasonably understand to be <em>implied</em>.</p>
<h3>NOTES TO APPENDIX.</h3>
<h5>(A \ See [p. 167, line 6</h5>
<p>It may, perhaps, occur to the Reader, who has studied Formal Logic that the argument, here applied to the Propositions <em>I</em> and <em>E</em>, will apply equally well to the Propositions <em>I</em> and <em>A</em> (since, in the ordinary text-books, the Propositions “All <em>x</em>y_ are <em>z</em>” and “Some <em>x</em>y_ are not <em>z</em>” are regarded as Contradictories). Hence it may appear to him that the argument might have been put as follows:—</p>
<p>“We now have <em>I</em> and <em>A</em> ‘asserting.’ Hence, if the Proposition ‘All <em>x</em>y_ are <em>z</em>’ be true, some things exist with the Attributes <em>x</em> and <em>y</em>: i.e. ‘Some <em>x</em> are <em>y</em>.’</p>
<p>“Also we know that, if the Proposition ‘Some <em>x</em>y_ are not-<em>z</em>’ be true the same result follows.</p>
<p>“But these two Propositions are Contradictories, so that one or other of them <em>must</em> be true. Hence this result is always true: i.e. the Proposition ‘Some <em>x</em> are <em>y</em>’ is <em>always</em> true!</p>
<p>“<em>Quod est absurdum.</em> Hence I <em>cannot</em> assert.”</p>
<p>This matter will be discussed in Part II; but I may as well give here what seems to me to be an irresistable proof that this view (that <em>A</em> and <em>I</em> are Contradictories), though adopted in the ordinary text-books, is untenable. The proof is as follows:—</p>
<p>With regard to the relationship existing between the Class ‘<em>x</em>y_’ and the two Classes ‘<em>z</em>’ and ‘not-<em>z</em>’, there are <em>four</em> conceivable states of things, viz.</p>
<p>Some <em>x</em>y_</p>
<p>are <em>z</em>,</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>some</p>
<p>are not-<em>z</em>;</p>
<p>〃</p>
<p>〃</p>
<p>none</p>
<p>〃</p>
<p>No <em>x</em>y_</p>
<p>〃</p>
<p>some</p>
<p>〃</p>
<p>〃</p>
<p>〃</p>
<p>none</p>
<p>〃</p>
<p>Of these four, No. (2 is equivalent to “All <em>x</em>y_ are <em>z</em>”, No. (3 is equivalent to “All <em>x</em>y_ are not-<em>z</em>”, and No. (4 is equivalent to “No <em>x</em>y_ exist.”</p>
<p>Now it is quite undeniable that, of these <em>four</em> states of things, each is, <em>a priori</em>, <em>possible</em>, some <em>one must</em> be true, and the other three <em>must</em> be false.</p>
<p>Hence the Contradictory to (2 is “Either (1 or (3 or (4 is true.” Now the assertion “Either (1 or (3 is true” is equivalent to “Some <em>x</em>y_ are not-<em>z</em>”; and the assertion “(4 is true” is equivalent to “No <em>x</em>y_ exist.” Hence the Contradictory to “All <em>x</em>y_ are <em>z</em>” may be expressed as the Alternative Proposition “Either some <em>x</em>y_ are not-<em>z</em>, or no <em>x</em>y_ exist,” but <em>not</em> as the Categorical Proposition “Some <em>y</em> are not-<em>z</em>.”      ) ) </p>
<h5>(B \ See [p. 171, at end of Section 2</h5>
<p>There are yet <em>other</em> views current among “The Logicians”, as to the “Existential Import” of Propositions, which have not been mentioned in this Section.</p>
<p>One is, that the Proposition “some <em>x</em> are <em>y</em>” is to be interpreted, neither as “Some <em>x</em> <em>exist</em> and are <em>y</em>”, nor yet as “If there <em>were</em> any <em>x</em> in existence, some of them <em>would</em> be <em>y</em>”, but merely as “Some <em>x</em> <em>can be</em> <em>y</em>; i.e. the Attributes <em>x</em> and <em>y</em> are <em>compatible_”. On _this</em> theory, there would be nothing offensive in my telling my friend Jones “Some of your brothers are swindlers”; since, if he indignantly retorted “What do you <em>mean</em> by such insulting language, you scoundrel?”, I should calmly reply “I merely mean that the thing is <em>conceivable_——that some of your brothers _might possibly</em> be swindlers”. But it may well be doubted whether such an explanation would <em>entirely</em> appease the wrath of Jones!</p>
<p>Another view is, that the Proposition “All <em>x</em> are <em>y</em>” <em>sometimes</em> implies the actual <em>existence</em> of <em>x</em>, and <em>sometimes</em> does <em>not</em> imply it; and that we cannot tell, without having it in <em>concrete</em> form, <em>which</em> interpretation we are to give to it. <em>This</em> view is, I think, strongly supported by common usage; and it will be fully discussed in Part II: but the difficulties, which it introduces, seem to me too formidable to be even alluded to in Part I, which I am trying to make, as far as possible, easily intelligible to mere <em>beginners</em>.</p>
<h5>(C \ See [p. 173, § 4</h5>
<p>The three Conclusions are</p>
<p>“No conceited child of mine is greedy”;<br>“None of my boys could solve this problem”;<br>“Some unlearned boys are not choristers.”</p>

<h3>Transcriber&#39;s Note</h3>
<p>This book contains a large number of line drawn illustrations which are un-credited. These did not reproduce well in this medium and have been re-drawn electronically as close as possible to the original. A number of transcription errors were found in the original book. As these were clearly not part of the Author’s intention they have, as far as possible, been identified and corrected in accordance with the methods given by the Author. These corrections have also been marked with an underline as e.g. construct, so that the original text may be seen by hovering the mouse cursor over the corrected element. In these notes the word ‘natural’ identifies a letter symbol occurring without a prime mark.</p>
<p>In the original book at the top of page 97, the following text occurred: N.B. The numbers at the foot of each page indicate the pages where the corresponding matter may be found. In accordance with the un-paged medium here this has been changed to: N.B. Reference tags for Examples, Answers &amp; Solutions will be found in the right margin.</p>
<p>The part of the book to which this relates contains, by sections, “Examples” (Exercises for the student), “Answers” (to the Examples &amp; “Solutions” (Worked Answers). All Example sections have corresponding Answer sections. For Sections 2 &amp; 3, worked Solutions are not supplied; for Sections 4–7, Solutions are given by 2 different methods. In association with this, the original text contained editorial notes at the foot of each page giving the page numbers for the related Sections. In this version, these notes are replaced with hyperlinks: for each Section the marginal marker which is given at the top of the Section identifies the current location and by clicking on it the reader is taken on a round tour of the related Sections.</p>
